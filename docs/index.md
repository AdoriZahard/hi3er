<p align="center">**Eg: Su2 = Su - Signet of Bodhi Core 2 (Dictum of Bodhi)**</p>

<p align="center">The signets are arranged in order of priority</p>

Please note that this is only true for there reward scores, and not the actual previous difficulties pre v5.6

**What do these mean?**

- Yes = At some point get this signet. It doesn't matter when, just that you obtain it, as its a signet needed to make the build work.
- 1st/2nd/etc = Get this 1st/2nd/etc
- Start = Start with this signet
- Optional = You can take it, but not necessary (mostly if your stigmatas' are bad)
- Filler = Only consider going for this if the other portals suck.
- No = Don't get this.

### <p align="center">-- General Build</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.1. AKA is yet another one of these valkyries that needs quite the particular investment for comfily using in ER. She wants a minimum rank of S2, and she also wants her pri-arm, without which she struggles quite noticeably. However, there's also something else that adds up into her performance at ER. She's also a highly difficult mechanical valk to optimally play with, as she does have quite a lot of tricks going for her. Most notably, animation cancels, which arguably do provide quite a big and drastic DPS increase for her, both inside and outside ER.

> Boss to be Chosen: Husk, then Vill-V or Kalpas

!!! note
    Aponia is just easier. Kosma is not recommended due to FR lacking enough hitcount potential which would take her too long during the hitcount phases.


####<p align="center">Setup</p>

SS0 | Finality | Skadi Pri & 3-set Ana | 10:08m (6.1) | [https://youtu.be/8DI2mKbHxNY](https://youtu.be/8DI2mKbHxNY)

!!! danger
    In downscalability terms, she's downright bad below SS rank. At a minimum of S2 rank however, she isn't as bad, but one problem still remains, she needs her signature Pri. With weaker stigmatas, expect her performance to decrease. Choose difficulty accordingly.

Buff | Load
:----: | :----: 
Valkyries gain an additional 10 SP for every 60 SP restored. | 5
Max SP increases by 30. | 5
Deployed Valkyries Total DMG increases 15%. This effect is negated 5s after taking DMG. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 10

!!! note
    Effective for 6.1.

:----: | :----: | :----:
Early | Veil of Tears | The Lonely Moon OR Because of You
Mid | Forbidden Seed / Memory / Rainbow of Absence | Because of You (F5 Shop) / Boundless Logos
Late | The First Scale | Boundless Logos

!!! note
    With Willows and assuming same rank (SS), it's possible for AKA to instead start with Because of You and get her 2 Ego signets for F7, which will then open the opportunity to get Boundless Logos by F9.

Time | Support 1 | Support 2
:----: | :----: | :----:
Early | AE | LE
Mid | AE | BK
Late | AE | HB

!!! note
    Remember to switch out LE for BK at F9/F10 before Heimdall fight. As for LE, you can switch her out once you get yourself a SP regen source like Aponia's. HB on the other hand is better after Heimdall fight, as she will provide highest damage. BR is not recommended due to AKA wanting to stay at more than 70% HP.

####<p align="center">Elysia - Signet of ■■</p>

Signet | Priority
------|:----:
**Blessing of Frost Scythe**: Tap [ATK] after evasion to hurl Frost Guisarmier which spins for 5s, gathers enemies nearby, and deal 5400% ATK of Ice DMG. CD: 10s | **Start**

**Blessing of Uranian Mirror**: Burst mode consumes 100% more SP and Valkyrie deals 90% bonus Total DMG in burst mode | No

!!! note
    This build mainly relies on 2 Ego signets with 2 other serving as a huge powerspike: Starting with Frost Scythe + Stellar Trails. Frost Scythe will act as your means of reliable gather, being a strong one at that, and also providing pretty decent amounts of damage on a 8s CD. Be mindful of this to spam it every 8 seconds. The other 2 Ego Signets to get are Winter Harvest + Cold Moon. Do NOT get Uranian Mirror.

####<p align="center">Aponia - Signet of Discipline (1st Core)</p>

!!! note
    Ideal course of build up: 2 Ego start into Aponia SP Regen F3, finish Aponia 2nd Core by F4, go shop F5 and swap The Lonely Moon for Because of You, buy Aponia's Penance if possible, otherwise get Mobius' Lip Poison [E] and Hua's Elem Breach. Can upgrade Aponia's Ultimate. Grab Aponia door F6 for Breach and finish Mobius 1st Core by F7 with Entwined [P] and Rodent [V].

Signet | Priority

**Fourth, No Insolence**: Exhortation increases by 5 per second and caps at 200. Ultimate's Physical and Elemental DMG increases by 0.3% of of Exhortation. Using weapon skills reduces 50% Exhortation. | 3rd

In Penance, the Valkyrie takes 30% less Total DMG and deals 40% more Physical and Elemental DMG to enemies. Valkyrie deals 800% ATK of Adaptive DMG to attacking enemies when hit; CD: 5s. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 2nd

!!! note
    Lip Poison gives a good damage increase to AKA's Crescent Harvest (her Summoned Entity). Dead [X] is also strongly recommended to get as a sharp damage increase for AKA.

####<p align="center">Hua - Signet of Vicissitude (3rd Core)</p>

Signet | Priority

## Bright Knight: Excelsis

### <p align="center">-- Dudu becomes a Jojo Fan</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.1. Dudu got her own stand, and she's on her way to become a real Jojo of her own. Truly built different! Will her stand be as powerful as Jojo's Star Platinum? Oh, an enemy is approaching! How dare they approach her? They must be destroyed by Abyss Flower! Wait... it did really destroy them easily. She's... a monster! Anyway, her damage ceiling is astronomically high. She's a pretty straightforward valkyrie that doesn't have much problems clearing it, however, her requirement for this is to have 3-set Dante and AF is a given.

> Boss to be Chosen: Hephaestus, then Aponia

!!! note
    Aponia really was sent into the afterlife from standing in BK's way. There's no stopping her. Oh no.

SS0 | Finality | Abyss Flower & 3-set Dante | 9:51m (6.1) | [https://youtu.be/Ja3yyEc2mQI](https://youtu.be/Ja3yyEc2mQI)

!!! danger
    Truthfully, you shouldn't even bother with this Valkyrie if you don't have BOTH of the shit she needs, which is basically AF and 3-set Dante. AF is a given, and evne more so in the current weather since it is what enables BK to abuse the 20% TDT on Timestop Load Buff. As for the 3-set Dante? There's just... no replacement for it. Other than maybe coping with 3-set Dirac. But, again, let's be honest... that's, uh, pretty awkward to cope with. BK really needs the impair right from the get go.

Buff | Load
:----: | :----: 
Valkyries gain an additional 10 SP for every 60 SP restored. | 5
Deployed Valkyries Total DMG increases 15%. This effect is negated 5s after taking DMG. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 10
When the stage timer is paused, Total DMG received by all enemies on the field increases by 20% for 15s. Triggering it again resets the duration.| 15

Early | Veil of Tears | The Lonely Moon
Mid | Forget-Me-Not / Gold Goblet / Rainbow of Absence | Because of You (F5 Shop)
Late | Key to the Deep | The Lonely Moon OR Dreamful Gold

!!! note
    The Lonely Moon is a must to get F4 Double guaranteed. Also, regarding Because of You, BK honestly doesn't even need a 4th Ego signet... so, if by F5 or F6 doors you see an Ego door, then by any means go ahead and take it. This way, you won't have to use Because of You.

Time | Support 1 | Support 2
:----: | :----: | :----:
Early | SS | SN
Mid | SS | SA
Late | SS | BR

!!! note
    SN is mainly to deal with the early Quantum mobs as they are too tanky for her without being collapsed. Afterwards, SN is swapped out for SA or BR, depends on your preference (gather and damage vs pure stonks damage)

Signet | Priority
------|:----:
**Blessing of Gambit**: Triggering Retaliation or Ultimate Evasion boosts Physical DMG by 25% for 8s. If triggered outside Burst mode, Valkyrie gains Iron Body for 8s; if triggered in Burst mode, Valkyrie additionally unleashes a counterattack cross strike before Phantom Cleave to deal 1200% ATK of Physical DMG | **Start** 
**Blessing of Paragon**: Ultimate grants 5 stacks of Paragon, each of which boosts Total DMG by 4% for 15s | 1st
**Blessing of Glory**: In Burst mode, Weapon Active has 70% shorter CD and can deal 2400% ATK of bonus Physical DMG at the cost of 12 SP. Weapon Active gains 4% Total DMG boost per second, and the boost resets when Burst mode is activated again | 2nd
**Blessing of Formation**: Basic ATK SEQ 5 creates a 3-sec Grav Singularity that pulls in surrounding enemies and deals 2100% ATK of Physical DMG to them. Basic ATK SEQ 4 & 5 and the explosion of the Grav Singularity boost Valkyrie's Total DMG by 3% for 40s (15 stacks max) | Optional 3rd
**Blessing of Holy Lance**: During Basic ATK SEQ 4, tap [ATK] repeatedly to thrust the lance at enemies in an increasingly violent manner to deal a total of 6000% ATK of Physical DMG, and Valkyrie is immune to frontal and flank attacks. When Valkyrie's SEQ 4 attack reaches its peak, Basic ATK SEQ 5 will be enhanced to deal 3500% ATK of bonus Physical DMG to enemies in a large area | No

!!! note
    Gambit and Paragon are her must-start signets. Those are the 2 main signets that will carry BK throughout the whole run. A 3rd Ego signet is strongly recommended to get for Glory. BK honestly doesn't even need the remaining 2 Ego signets, but you can take Formation as your 4th Ego.

####<p align="center">Aponia - Signet of Discipline (1st Core)</p>

!!! note
    Ideal course of build up: 2 Ego start (Gambit + Paragon) into Aponia's Ultimate by F3, finish Aponia 2nd Core by F4 Doubles, go shop F5 and put Because of You, buy Griseo's Red Paint and Sakura's TDM Taken or 1 extra UE Charge signets, grab Aponia's Breach at F6 and finish Sakura's 1st Core by F7

In Penance, the Valkyrie takes 30% less Total DMG and deals 40% more Physical and Elemental DMG to enemies. Valkyrie deals 800% ATK of Adaptive DMG to attacking enemies when hit; CD: 5s. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 2nd
**You Shall Punish Evil**: Enemies struck by You Shall Know Your Sins two or more times take 40% more Total DMG. 5 SP is restored when these enemies are hit by You Shall Know Your Sins. | 3rd

    Ultimate is a must priority to upgrade to +3. It will not only enormously boost BK's damage in Burst Mode but will also affect AF's damage.

### <p align="center">-- General Build</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.1. Aponia being one of the strongest Flamechasers available to do ER with, is also a valk that doesn't really demands much mechanical play. There's really not much to explain about her. Aponia in ER is basically a get 100 sp, use Ultimate, hold A for Thunderstorm and move or just watch a video while enemies die. Then gain SP again and repeat the same process. More explanation on her is given in the description of the video runs.

    Yeah. Fighting herself. That's how things should be. Right?

### <p align="center">-- General Build</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.1. Do note that FR needs her Pri-arm if you want to use her for ER. Due to the complex mechanics that FR has, she's one of the harder valks to properly play into ER. In fact, much like certain other valks, her performance won't only depend on her gears and ranks, but also will depend on how optimally you can play her. As long as you can consistently and properly do her Evade cancels (especially taking note of Strix-the bird rune- getting off CD to spam him) into Charged ATKs one after another, you can expect things to go well. Her greatest dps is between her ult and the successive Charged ATK chain. 

> Boss to be Chosen: Hephaestus, then Aponia or Kosma

!!! note
    Aponia is just easier. Kosma is not recommended due to FR lacking enough hitcount potential which would take her too long during the hitcount phases.

    In downscalability terms, even below SS2 where FR unlocks her "dps" potential outside ER, she should be fine here. With lower gears as well. However, do note that FR is a valk that requires her Pri-weapon in order to be used in ER, simply due to the instant Valfreyja Form.

## Golden Diva
Quick search: Eden, GD

![Vercel GD](https://elysian-realm.vercel.app/valkyries/golden-diva-min.png)

### <p align="center">-- General Build 7D</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.1. As far as testing goes, this is the current best build for Eden, and other variations with different signets are either weaker, or just don't really work as well as they would seem to do in paper. Take Eden2 for instance, which supposedly GD would be perfectly fine with. Issue? It actually isn't that great. Only acceptable as a versatile option when you don't have any other better alternatives for doors, but otherwise, not recommended to do as early start, as it's garbage.

> Boss to be Chosen: Husk or Hephaestus, then Aponia or Vill-V

!!! note
    Hephaestus is only recommended if you actually have both DoI & Handel to go with. Eden has the capability to kill Hephaestus before he goes into Overheat mode. If you do not have the confidence to kill it before it goes Overheat mode, then just go with Husk.

SSS | Finality | DoI & Handel | 9:03m (6.0 2nd Half) | [https://youtu.be/iWKlVGS9wnU](https://youtu.be/iWKlVGS9wnU)

!!! danger
    In terms of downscalability, as long as you have Handel, GD won't be as painful to use, particularly because the atk difference does play in quite a big manner for her damage. It's also due to DoI's buffs difference.

**Blessing of Symphony**: Hurl pistols when using Ensemble Playing for 12 SP and dealing 350% Lightning DMG | No

!!! note
    This build requires only 3 Ego signets to function: Arioso + Fugue into Cadenza. You can also additionally take a 4rd Ego door for Concerto, or if you plan on using Eden2, take Symphony, but otherwise NEVER take Symphony, as it heavily relies on minimum 2 SP regen sources (Aponia2 and Eden2).

!!! danger
    Regarding 2 diff Startup importance: Aponia which includes her Boundless Feeling support skill is weaker for F4 Double, but is a bit stronger start after getting her core. Kosma on the other hand provides easily accessible and comfortable gather, while also being stronger for F4 Double and can very likely guarantee it. This run will assume Aponia start. For Kosma start, you just switch the priority order between the two. (Kosma 1st, Aponia 3rd)

####<p align="center">Aponia - Signet of Discipline (1st Core)</p>

!!! note
    Ideal course of build up: 3 Ego start into Aponia's Basic or Ultimate F3, unlock Aponia 2nd Core by F4, go shop F5, buy 2 of either Kosma or Kalpas signets and reroll for either door accordingly to unlock their core by F6, otherwise Aponia door for enhanced. If you CAN get Kalpas 2nd Core by F6 over Kosma2, then grab Aponia for F7 double

Instead, we give some real motivation to Sakura by giving her a nice gift to carve her path towards becoming a real Vergil! Who needs Naraka? Why craft it and pri-arm it when you can instead give 7T to Memento? That's much better! Trust me!

> Boss to be Chosen: Hephaestus, then Aponia or Kalpas

!!! note
    Make sure to avoid being at less than 900 HP when going against Hephaestus. In this run I had forgotten about the fact and proceeded to go against him with less than 100 HP. I had to retry a lot until I managed to beat him lmao.

    Other sets like Bastet can work for Memento, but you can expect it to be weaker probably, due to it giving nothing more than just TDM becoming diluted on her as opposed to Ana Schariac having a lot of different multipliers. Naraka can work for weapon.

    Whiteout and Florish are the must start for Memento. It is strongly recommended and advised to reset for F2 Ego start to grab Haste, as it's a signet that will become pretty strong and act as a good powerspike for Memento later on as she starts scaling towards the late floors.

!!! note
    Whilst not necessary, the Ultimate signet is not a bad idea to get for 2 reasons mainly. One, it will increase the load per second to 30, which is good to consider for Memento due to the rate at which she halvens Aponia's Load. Second, it will also increase your Ultimate's DMG. However, do note that this will modify your playstyle into using 7T Active only whenever you have to reapply Griseo's Red Paint. On the other hand, Basic ATK is priority to upgrade to +3.

!!! note
    Both enhanceds are really good to take. Memento synergizes extremely well with Eden2 due to her capability to spam her low-cd Ult to keep refreshing Eden2. Silent Night is also really good as it will act as another form of breach aside from Aponia's.

Memento didn't had enough fun with 7T and thought it was too simple and easy for her, so she got rid of it and decided to go to a back alley, proceeded to buy a 3* weapon of doubtful quality from a merchant by the name of Senti, got back home and chose the highest difficulty to prove she isn't any weaker and can also do it herself. Was it worth the 500,000,000 yen that the 3* weapon cost her? Did she get scammed by Senti? Or does that not matter? Turns out even the highest difficulty couldn't stop her and she became an unstoppable force of nature! What an absolute madlad!

!!! danger
    Do note that the best start for this build is Griseo's Red Paint at F2, so it's strongly recommended to mald for it instead of Ego signet.

> Boss to be Chosen: Hephaestus, then Aponia or Kalpas

!!! note
    Between Aponia or Kalpas, you can bully either of the two. Pick your preference.

    In order to have the best chances at getting F4 Double, you need the skills to time the charging every 6s aside from getting into the F4 with FPL fully charged already.

    Sneer has very good synergy in this build due to increasing the frequency in which Memento can make use of and abuse V-V's buffs, aside from granting her some nice SP Regen which in turn will also synergize very well later with Eden2. Puppetry and Drama are priority to +3.

!!! note 
    Updated 6.1. All in all, HC is one of the easiest valks to play in ER, and her gameplay doesn't involve anything complicated. The only thing of note to be mindful of is that she greatly values gather as it's better for her to be hitting every mob due to her AoE damage being pretty damn strong. 

> Boss to be Chosen: Hephaestus, then Aponia or Kosma

!!! note
    While HC can take Kosma and deal with the hitcount phases the easiest, you can also instead take Aponia, but do keep in mind to manually end your Burst Mode before transition phases to save SP and ult again.

    In the SS1 run, I picked VK as she gives 20% Fire Taken. However, do note that VK is harder to use for the purpose of denying Heimdall's Red Mode. This is because VK applies mid Heavy Trauma throughout many successive hits that NEED to connect with Heimdall. If you do not want to be resetting the fight until VK successfully does her job, then just pick BK instead.

    2 important things. Kalpas TDM on F3 is an absolute must, as it's the strongest buff HoFS can get that will also guarantee you'll have an easy time clearing F4 for the double reward. The other DMG buff doesn't come close, and the other 2 are a no. 
    And you leave Kalpas enhanceds for later on. 2 reasons. Getting Hua 2nd Core finished by F6 and Sakura 1st Core by F7 is a way stronger ramp up than getting Kalpas Breach which doesn't have much effect early on. And trying to get one after finishing his 2nd core is a massive slowdown on the pace, as it feels like it's not really doing anything to help u. This is the reason getting other signets instead is better. So, leave this for after you get 2nd core.

!!! note
    I also strongly recommend upgrading Kalpas' Max HP after both of his DMG boosts if you're using Himeko. Himeko M giving 25% max HP paired with Kalpas 40% Max HP from +3 and Pardofelis Max HP signet makes it possible to reach up to 16k or 17k HP which gives Kalpas an absolutely massive scaling on his +3 DMG Boosts.

!!! note
    The minimum requirement of Tuna is to have Heatflow and Reburn as her starting signets. Without Reburn, she feels awful to play. Without Heatflow, she doesn't feel like she has much damage. So, a double Ego start is essential for Tuna. Afterwards, getting a 3rd Ego door is very good, taking Tempered Warrior to make the entire run easier and feel better. 4th is also taken for Starfire, adding even more damage but it's not really necessary.

####<p align="center">Kalpas - Signet of Decimation (1st Core)</p>

!!! danger
    You leave Kalpas enhanceds for later on. 2 reasons. Getting a Sakura signet or being able to finish Hua 2nd Core by F7 double or even getting Tempered Warrior is higher value. And trying to get one after finishing his 2nd core is a massive slowdown on the pace, as it feels like it's not really doing anything to help u. This is the reason getting other signets instead is better. So, leave this for after you get 2nd core.

!!! note
    I also strongly recommend upgrading Kalpas' Max HP after both of his DMG boosts if you're using Himeko. Himeko M giving 25% max HP paired with Kalpas 40% Max HP from +3 and Pardofelis Max HP signet makes it possible to reach up to 16k or 17k HP which gives Kalpas an absolutely massive scaling on his +3 DMG Boosts. When using Shelley T Himeko M Scott B variation, it's even more of a priority as it reaches up to 22.5k HP.

    Sakura's Core is not necessary to complete. After getting Fuji, you can proceed to focus on getting Griseo and finishing Sakura 1st core on later floors, particularly after Mech Land. Also, Ayame is good to consider taking for the purposes of getting Yellow applied through early Ultimate so you can get your maximum damage output as soon as possible, however you can also instead pick Eden's Initial/Max SP for this.

    Lip Poison start is the most meaningful, as it has more noticeable damage increase.

!!! note
    The moment you get any of the basic paints of Griseo, the gameplay changes. It's essential to save the weapon active and UE skill to time them together with her Ultimate, having all 3 paints. Taint Extension is also very crucial for this, as the +0 alone will increase the duration from 8s to 13s, making up for an entire ult duration of 2 complete series of Victory Slashes.

    Updated 6.1. This is the 3rd strongest build, and also competes with the others in being the most braindead to play... sort of. The strength of this build is that it is very solid and has damage on everything. 4-5, 7T actives, Dragon slam, Finisher, Shinzan. Overall, it's pretty good.

    Do note though, that this build is not recommended if your HoT is not S1+. Narukami Finisher is stronger.

    This build's downscalability in terms of weapon and stigmatas has yet to be tested.

However, if you do have them, even if underleveled, then you can downscale accordingly.

    These above are listed based on their potential strength. First listed is the strongest. Also, watch out for builds without SirinA M or Elysia M, as the playstyle changes a bit.

    This build is downscaleable with lower clear times and lower gear requirement. You don't necessarily have to do Finality, as such, with lower difficulties, you'll either have faster, about the same or lower clear time depending on your gear requirement.

!!! note
    Innateness is a must, Coleus is needed, so double Ely start is the best. It's also strongly recommended to grab a 3rd and even 4th Ego door. Your choice is between Virtuality or Annihilation, and it comes down to personal preference as both are strong in their own with almost no noticeable difference whatsoever, however, if you don't like Virtuality's downsides (can make mobs have delayed spawn or lock some enemies in the air in a way that HoV can't target them and reduce her CD's with Innateness), then Annihilation is taken for smoother gameplay.

**Blessing of Innateness**: Reduces CD of Ultimate Evasion Skill, weapon skill and Ultimate by 6s each when summoning Space Core. In Herrscher Form, Basic ATKs directly connect to SEQ 3 for a short duration after triggering Ultimate Evasion. | **Start**

!!! note
    Innateness is a must, Law is the core of this build. You can also take 3rd and 4th Ego doors, which would respectively be Coleus and Virtuality. They aren't needed, however they are nice to have, especially Coleus for the gather. Virtuality on the other hand lets you play safely.

####<p align="center">Mobius - Signet of Infinity (1st Core)</p>

!!! note
    2 Ego Start, Entwined [P] by F2, finish Mobius 1st Core by F4 with Rodent [V] and Lip Poison [E], go shop F5, grab Griseo's Red Paint and Sakura's TDM Taken, TDM or Fuji and swap Forbidden Seed to Rainbow of Absence, get Dead [X] by F6 and finish Griseo 2nd Core by F7.

**Nexus Signet 1: Infinite [X]** |
**Dead [X]**: For every second in Mind Sync, Valkyrie herself, summoned entities, ELFs, and Support Valkyries deal 10% bonus Total DMG. 5 stacks max. 9 stacks max with any summoned entity present. Reset on exiting Mind Sync | 1st
**Unknown [X]**: Triggering Mind Sync again during Mind Sync reduces the CD of ELF Ultimates and Support Valkyries' support skills by 2s. With any summoned entity present, the CDs are reduced by 2s additionally. This effect can only be triggered once per 4s. | Optional

!!! note
    Dead [X] is an absolute must especially with downscaled gears as it makes up for a really significant buff to damage for the remainder of the run once you get it. Lodging and Unknown can be taken when downscaling or when no better options.

####<p align="center">Griseo - Signet of Stars (2nd Core)</p>

**Yellow & Warm**: Using an Ultimate taints enemies nearby with yellow paint for 8s and makes them take 30% bonus Total DMG. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 2nd
**Black & Dark**: Every time an enemy is tainted, Valkyries deals 10% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG for 20s. 6 stacks max. | 3rd

!!! note
    Red & Hot is the absolute first priority, followed by Yellow & Warm and Black & Dark. A Flame Extinguished is ideal 1st in this build due to ease of proc for finishing with Ultimate and because of the 40% Phys Def reduction, however if you end up missing one of the 3 paints, take one of the other 3 enhanceds according to which ones you have.

!!! note
    Hua here is mainly for the unconditional Breach which you'll want to prioritize to upgrade. It is also the safest way to play HoV thanks to her shield, and especially as Kalpas2 + BR is used for this. Virtuality helps to offset this to some extent however, if you don't manage to get Hua's 2nd core in the run.

### <p align="center">-- Unlimited Blade Works Build - Aponia Variation</p>

!!! note 
    Updated for 6.1. This build basically focuses on A spam. It's her strongest general build, taking into account ranks, downscaling and weather-related buffs & debuffs. On the other hand, however, it is heavily reliant on gather. The strongest variation of Sussy's UBW build, which fully utilizes Aponia signets' strength alongside Griseo, resulting in a really deadly and strong as fuck build that melts through enemies easily like a rain of millions of knives going through butter.

> Boss to be Chosen: Hephaestus, then Elysia, Mobius, Aponia or Vill-V

!!! note
    There's no particular preference over each other in regards to the bosses. Aponia has the inconvenience of making Sushang's Sword Array dissapear so you have to fill Blade Mantra up to full to use it again as you won't have ult back by the time she transitions to P2. Mobius, on the other hand, is more comfortable with gather. V-V is easy, just lock on the turret until it's destroyed. Elysia, however, is the tankiest boss so if your damage isn't looking good enough, go with the other bosses instead.

    Sus is a pretty strong valkyrie in her own right, and her downscalability is one of the best amongst the available valkyries in ER.

Early | Veil of Tears | The Lonely Moon OR Boundless Feeling
Mid | Rainbow of Absence / Gold Goblet / Mad King's Mask | The Lonely Moon
Late | Tin Flask or Key to the Deep | The Lonely Moon

!!! note
    You can choose to start with Boundless Feeling for the free +1 upgrade value on every Aponia signet picked. TLM's best value is by F9 after you're done getting all 3 Aponia's Enhanceds at which point you can proceed with Griseo signets.

Time | Support 1 | Support 2
:----: | :----: | :----:
Early | BR | LE
Mid | BR | LE / BK
Late | BR | LE

!!! note
    LE allows you for instant ult at the beginning of every floor. With Nocturnal Sheath, she also allows you to get the 175sp cost down right away, for maximum buffs benefit from the extra 25 sp mechanic of Sussy. BK, on the other hand, can be taken for Heimdall if you don't feel confident enough on your damage or your RNG with the signets gotten. VC is the best choice for comfortable gather if u want it.

### <p align="center">-- Unlimited Blade Works Build - Hua & Kosma Variation</p>

!!! note 
    Updated for 6.1. This build basically focuses on A spam. It's her strongest general build, taking into account ranks, downscaling and weather-related buffs & debuffs. On the other hand, however, it is heavily reliant on gather. So, having as much means of reliable gather as possible is strongly recommended for this build. You can expect a sharp decline in the strength and efficiency if you're not hitting everyone. Without effective means of gather, this build effectively loses out by A LOT as its main effectiveness is through AoE hitting every monster which is achieved by gathering them. If you're hitting only one monster after the other, you'll notice really poor performance and results from this build.

> Boss to be Chosen: Hephaestus, then Mobius, Aponia or Vill-V (not recommended due to Hua)

!!! note
    There's no particular preference over each other in regards to the bosses. Aponia has the inconvenience of making Sushang's Sword Array dissapear so you have to fill Blade Mantra up to full to use it again as you won't have ult back by the time she transitions to P2. Mobius, on the other hand, needs gather which Kosma should easily provide.

    Sushang is a strong valkyrie in terms of downscalability.

!!! note
    With UBW build's weakness of being gather-reliant, Out of Reach provides you a really convenient means of gather. However, The Lonely Moon is more preferred as not only it helps guaranteeing double bonuses but also +1 to Griseo signets which you'll want to have at least 2 enhanceds before Heimdall fight.

!!! note
    AE's Elemental Breach does NOT stack with Sussy's. Due to this, she's weaker as a support of choice for her, and VC & HB are better options. Now, regarding who to choose. AE's advantages are for Early only: gather, 30% Elem Taken, SP Regen. VC is for the purposes of reliable and consistent gather only. HB, on the other hand, has WAY more DMG boost during all stages of the run. TLDR; HB for maximum damage bonus, VC for easy and reliable gather, AE for gather/elem taken early on.

    Two important things. One, it is NOT necessary to finish Kalpas 2nd Core. The reason is because Sushang has minor healing, which combined with BR, will ensure she'll stay at less than 1000 HP for the most part. Also, getting Kosma2 afterwards will make her permastay at 1 HP. You also want to abuse BR at shop the moment you get his DMG boosts. Always make sure to stay at less than 100 HP.

### <p align="center">-- Unlimited Blade Works Build [Eden & Su Variation]</p>

!!! note 
    Updated for 6.1. This build basically focuses on A spam. It's her strongest general build, taking into account ranks, downscaling and weather-related buffs & debuffs. This particular variant focuses in the use of Eden & Su, abusing the synergy that both have between themselves. However, do expect this build's strength to fall off when Eden is no longer +2.

> Boss to be Chosen: Hephaestus, then Mobius, Aponia or Vill-V (not recommended due to Hua)

!!! note
    There's no particular preference over each other in regards to the bosses. Aponia has the inconvenience of making Sushang's Sword Array dissapear so you have to fill Blade Mantra up to full to use it again as you won't have ult back by the time she transitions to P2. Mobius, on the other hand, needs gather which Kosma should easily provide.

    Sushang is a strong valkyrie in terms of downscalability. Basically, as shown by the run above done with GTX & Scott, her strength isn't that severely impacted from low gears. On more unfavorable weathers, however, this will become a bit more noticeable.

    AE's Elemental Breach does NOT stack with Sussy's. Regarding the other choices, LE is *only* used when you're using Sushang without her signature weapon, or when you don't have it, you instead swap her out the moment you get Eden's Initial/Max SP signet. Take this fact into consideration when switching out BR before Heimdall fight. Basically, keep LE if you don't have Nocturnal Stealth or once you get Eden's Initial/Max SP.

    BKE is only for the purposes of filling Heimdall's Heavy Trauma Bar, forcefully ending his Red Mode.

    Ideal Order from F1-F7: Double Ego Start for Ascension, grab Entwined [P] or Rodent [V] by F3, complete Mobius 1st Core by F4 with Entwined, Rodent, Lip Poison, take either Dead [X] or Unknown [X] by F5, then go shop, grab 2 Hua signets and 1 Kalpas signet and get a Hua door for F6 to complete her 2nd Core, swap Forbidden Seed out for Mad King's Mask, complete Kalpas 2nd Core by F7

Signet | Priority

**Entwined [P]:** :For every summoned entity, ELF, or Support Valkyrie present, enemies take 8% bonus Total DMG (5 stacks max) | 1st

**Lip Poison [E]:** Total DMG from summoned entities, ELFs, and Support Valkyries increases by 60%. ELFs | 3rd

**Nexus Signet 1: Infinite [X]** |
**Dead [X]**: For every second in Mind Sync, Valkyrie herself, summoned entities, ELFs, and Support Valkyries deal 10% bonus Total DMG. 5 stacks max. 9 stacks max with any summoned entity present. Reset on exiting Mind Sync | 1st or 2nd

!!! note
    Dead [X]'s impact is mainly from being a ramping up buff, so it's not so much of a problem to not get it early on. Unknown [X] has good use due to being able to spam AE and most importantly VC.

!!! note
    Hua is the best 2nd Core to get from testing results, contesting very hard with Kalpas2. The reason is due to Mobius lacking breach, which becomes even more evident if you leave it for in exchange to getting Griseo done.

    In terms of downscaling, LK probably doesn't have much options honestly. For cross, she can use Elysian Astra, 11th Leutorgia or maybe even cope with Basilisk, but in terms of stigmatas, it's even harder to say what works well with her. Honestly, you'd be better off just using someone else instead. Don't expect much from LK.

!!! note 
    Updated 6.1. Honestly, considering only base A ranks and non-Flame Chasers, Raven is probably one of the strongest valkyries to clear ER. At least, in weathers that are not so unfavorable for her. She's rather excellent, albeit a bit awkward and her gameplay pretty much just revolves around controlling the appropiate timings.

You can take BK for Heimdall if you want to be extra sure. However, if you have hands and the skill for it, you can go without BK and be fine for the fight. Raven can break Heimdall's shields easily through her Ultimate sequence. Breaking Heimdall's shields will keep him from going Red Mode until he's down to half HP.

    Sneer is really good to have as it will significantly reduce the downtime that Raven has to deal with waiting for Ult and reducing its CD due to Arrowhead. It also synergizes in that you can use Active beforehand for the bonuses of Puppetry and Drama.

**Blessing of Beauty**: Using weapon active restores 1 additional Ultimate Evasion charge. Enemies take 25% bonus Total DMG when a Crystalline Seed is attached to them. | 1st

**Blessing of Benevolence**: Infatuation is fully restored when Ultimate Evasion Skill is triggered. If Infatuation drops below 100 after using Charged Shot: Cupid's Bolt, you can consume 1 Ultimate Evasion charge to trigger Ultimate Evasion Skill. | No 

!!! note
    This build requires only 2, Zenith and Purity. Beauty is not necessary, however it's free 35% TDM Taken to take, which is really strong for early and for the rest of the run, so it is strongly advised that you do F2 Ego start. Otherwise, prefer to go for a Griseo F2 start for taking her Red paint.

####<p align="center">Vill-V - Signet of Helix (1st Core)</p>

!!! note
    Ideal Order from F1-F7: F2 Ego start for Beauty, then grab V-V's Conflict of Spider Web by F3, finish V-V 2nd core by F4, V-V F5 for either Puppetry or Drama, shop F6, swap Pseudo Miracle for Veil of Tears, get Griseo Red paint from Shop and Kalpas TDM or Phys/Elem DMG (If you get Kalpas DMG boosts, abuse trick with swapping BR, using her, removing her, rinse and repeat until you are below 300 HP to continue), and grab V-V F7 for missing Puppetry or Drama and get any missing priority basic signet from V-V.

    Ideal course of build up: 2 Ego Start (Exodus + Abyssal Chant) into V-V's Pendulum or Conflict F3, finish V-V's 2nd Core by F4 Double, go shop F5 and put Because of You, buy Griseo's Red paint and Sakura's 1 extra UE or TDM Taken, grab V-V's Puppetry or Drama F6 and go V-V door at F7 Double.

Signet | Priority
------|:----:
**Blessing of Exodus**: Valkyrie's total DMG is increased by 25%, and the last hit of Equinox Severance will shatter the ground and consume Knight Guardian, dealing 1200% of ATK as physical DMG to all enemies and impairing them for 12s, reducing the enemies' DEF by 30%. | **Start**
**Blessing of Abyssal Chant**: The physical DMG of Valkyrie is increased by 40%, the total DMG dealt by the Ultimate is increased by 180%, and the Ultimate Evasion Skill is refreshed twice after the Ultimate is cast. | 1st
**Blessing of Commitment**: Valkyrie's physical DMG is increased by 50%, and the total DMG of weapon skills increases by 60%. The first two hits of Equinox Severance restore 1 SP per hit and reduce Ultimate CD by 1s. CD: 20s. | 2nd
**Blessing of Equinox**: Valkyrie's total DMG is increased by 30%. Palatinus Equinox is enhanced when switching forms and unleashing the Ultimate. Valkyrie deals 30% more physical DMG for 15s, repeatedly triggering refreshes the duration. | 3rd
**Blessing of Gallop**: The physical DMG of Valkyrie is increased by 15%, and the physical DMG of Elite Thrust is increased by 0.4% for every 1% of HP lost. The physical DMG of Sprint is increased by 0.2%. Each hit reduces HP by 5% and grants 0.6 SP. Consumes Knight Guardian to restore all ICHOR. | No

!!! note
    Exodus and Abyssal Chant are vital so double start is essential. Exodus is the start, and Abyssal Chant is the 2nd Ego signet to take. The importance of it lies in that due to it recharging the UE charges instantly, PE really needs it to keep spamming Equinox Severance which will also give you a constant cycle of enough SP regen to keep using Ult anytime you need it and it comes back off CD. Commitment in the other hand increases PE's damage by a lot as it makes her Gunlance damage actually matter and be part of her big numbers. Additionally, Equinox Severance provides a small gather that might not be noticeable but it's actually very consistent and good. The radius of effect however isn't that big, so take note of that.

!!! note
    Because Of You is best taken by F5 shop: as early as possible, and it's only if you want to secure getting Midnight (see Ego signet section for more info). The Lonely Moon or Falling in Past Light as start depends on your preference; FPL preferred if you want to take the V-V start route, TLM for Aponia start route.

    You'll want to prioritize saving AE for gather sometimes if you are lacking in a ELF that has gather or while you don't have Vill-V's 2nd Core unlocked, as Fischl is straight up horrible without it. She's literally dependant on it due to her almost non-existent AoE damage, especially when lacking 3rd signet which is pretty much a requirement.

**Blessing of Retribution**: Grants 1 stack of Blessing of Retribution every 7s. 2 stacks max. QTE consumes 1 stack to create a small lightning field which lasts 2s and deals 3x225% ATK of Lightning DMG per 0.4s to enemies within. Starts with 2 stacks | **Start**
**Blessing of Fate**: When hitting an enemy weakspot with a weapon active, Oz unleashes dark lightning to deal 2000% ATK of Lightning DMG | 1st

**Blessing of Dark Wings**: When Ultimate Evasion Skill is triggered, Oz unleashes dark lightning to deal 4200% ATK of Lightning DMG | No

!!! note
    Fischl requires 3 Ego signets: Retribution into Fate start, then Midnight. 3rd Ego signet is a MUST because Fischl's personal and AoE damage is genuinely horrible without Midnight. It forms such a big part of her build here in ER that Fischl without any of these 3 signets becomes one of the weakest and most dogshit ER valks in the game. As such, Because of You is recommended to secure this.

!!! danger
    This build has 2 different startups to note: We're gonna assume V-V start. Aponia start is slightly stronger, but V-V start is more comfortable and preferred if you don't have any ELF that provides gather or don't want to bother too much resetting for spawn RNG and maintaining enemies in the circle for Retribution. That's the only importance of choice; whether you choose one or the other, their order of priority is just swapped up between them. (Aponia 1st, V-V 2nd) 

####<p align="center">Vill-V - Signet of Helix (1st Core)</p>

    Ideal course of build up: 2/3 Ego Start, finish V-V 2nd Core by F4 or F6, shop at F5, then either finish Aponia 2nd Core by F7 or grab V-V2's both Drama and Puppetry. For Aponia2, grab both the Breach and TDM Taken

!!! note
    Mobius is REALLY high priority to finish and get both Dead [X] and Newborn [X]. The reason is because of the way Oz works. Oz stays in field way too long, and Fischl's only means of recasting Oz to naturally refresh Mind Sync's duration is through the signet of Nightfall or through Ultimate Cast. This makes Newborn [X] as VERY essential and must-take alongside Dead [X]. Basically, Dead [X] won't be useful for long without Newborn [X] present.

    Do this build only for the fun of it, that's its purpose.

Late | Tin Flask or Key to the Deep | Falling in Past Light

!!! note
    Because Of You is best taken by F5 shop: as early as possible, and it's only if you want to secure getting Midnight (see Ego signet section for more info). The Lonely Moon or Falling in Past Light as start depends on your preference; FPL preferred if you want to take the V-V start route, TLM for Aponia start route.

!!! note
    You'll want to prioritize saving AE for gather sometimes if you are lacking in a ELF that has gather, as Fischl is straight up horrible without it. She's literally dependant on it due to her almost non-existent AoE damage, especially when lacking 3rd signet which is pretty much a requirement. Remember to bring BK before Heimdall fight. Afterwards, you can swap BK out for FR. FR will let you be more comfortable.

    Double Ego start is not necessary, Phantasma will just further make it easier.

    An very important thing to note here, if you don't have Purana, you shouldn't be taking Cat's Eyes at all. Purana is essential in that just by having it, you can then ignore Tailpiece. However, if you don't have it, as you'll be missing the 30% CD reduction on ultimate, you need Tailpiece because otherwise your ult will be on CD and Runaway state will run out. Tailpiece helps negate this.

### <p align="center">-- Tap and Hold A, Watch Youtube</p>

!!! note
    Updated 6.1. SW is very straightforward. And a bit clunky too, but otherwise a strong non-Herrscher valkyrie for ER. However, I can't attest for her strength with downscaled gears. She's reliant on her signature weapon, and her own signature stigmata set provides too much stuff that she does utilize very well while other alternatives are sort of lacking. Nevermind Ana.

    There are 2 Ego signets that SW starts with, and other 2 Ego signets that are strongly recommended for her to take. Phantom Plumes start into Grey Falcon is her strongest startup. Do note that Grey Falcon modifies her playstyle from spamming A button into holding A repeatedly for shotgun SW, which is her biggest damage alongside her ult after getting Pale Feathers. The other 2 Ego signets that SW strongly wants are Pale Feathers and Silver Eagle.

### <p align="center">-- Rita's Training Arc 7D</p>

!!! note
    Updated 6.1. SpA had enough of sitting in the bench just warming it while watching other valkyries push ahead of her, so she decided to finally take matters into her hands and train to become a better valkyrie and catch up to the others! And she sure did went a bit overboard... by becoming even stronger than before! SpA's strength in favorable weathers is pretty strong and she also becomes a fairly easy valk to clear ER with. Although she struggles even more against Psy mobs. 


>   Boss to be chosen: Hephaestus, then Aponia or Vill-V

!!! note
    You should consider Hephaestus' Overheat mechanic. You might not be able to kill him. If you're not confident in doing so, you can instead go with Husk, but he's more annoying due to SpA's lack of i-frames which makes her be reliant on manual dodging even more, as she already uses Kosma.

### <p align="center">-- Kosma Build 7D</p>

!!! note
    Updated 6.1. This valk is fucking awful. Honest truth. Her early game absolutely sucks, even as SS-rank, and loses against valks like Fischl and Eden in that regard. She only starts ramping up in strength after Benares, but even then, she still sucks a bit as she becomes mediocre at best. If anything, I would honestly recommend to play other valks instead of this shitty valk. She just really sucks, nothing more.

>   Boss to be chosen: Hephaestus OR Husk, then Aponia or Vill-V

!!! note
    You should consider Hephaestus' Overheat mechanic. You might not be able to kill him. If you're not confident in doing so, you can instead go with Husk, but he's more annoying due to SpA's lack of i-frames which makes her be reliant on manual dodging even more, as she already uses Kosma.

Quick search: Seele

![SHE LOOKS SO PRETTY IK](https://elysian-realm.vercel.app/images/starchasm-nyx-min.png)

### <p align="center">-- Veliona Tries to Survive</p>

!!! note
    Updated 6.1. Nyx is a sort of straightforward valkyrie to play in ER. Relying on the generation of Carmine Gashes to recover SP for herself and get ready to ult everytime, she actually has a quite comfortable downtime. However, this is locked behind the requirement of needing one of her Ego signets. For a full explanation, you can read the video run's description.

>   Boss to be chosen: Hephaestus, then Vill-V or Aponia

!!! note
    Nyx might struggle finishing Aponia off before she goes flying in her P2. If u want faster clear time, V-V is the choice.

!!! note
    Nyx as a whole can be assumed to be very screwed with downscaled gear, as her strength early on is on the weak side. Not only her own signature weapon helps her a lot, but also other stigmata choices lose out on more than 20% DPS comparison to Verne. Simply speaking, for downscalability purposes, expect this valk to be more affected the worse the gears are.

However, you can delay this powerspike for F11 if your Nyx is struggling to get F4 doubles by using FPL or TLM, taking in mind that FPL will let you +3 the V-V signets which is more value.

### <p align="center">-- Just Stfu</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.1. If anyone tells you that StFu can't do ER, you can show this to them! Or... you can do it yourself! Provided you actually wouldn't mind balding for making this valkyrie work, that is... Wait, this valk actually isn't that bad! Okay, but seriously. What can I say? StFu's strength as a valkyrie for ER is also pretty mid, but leaning towards somewhat strong. Though this comes with quite a number of downsides that StFu has, naturally making her not a better choice than other particular valks.

    For downscalability purposes, let's be honest, she aint gonna do shit without 3-set Dirac as she badly needs the 50% impair for the early game. Dirac also provides with other useful things that StFu wants. 7T, on the other hand, is easily her BiS here due to it allowing StFu to reapply Griseo's Red Paint easily anytime.

    The Lonely Moon is very essential to have the best chances at getting F4 double. Because of You is also essential due to SN's massive reliance on her own Ego signets, as they act as a mid but decent powerspike to her.

    Do note that the usage of supports is very important to time out together with SN's burst windows, as they provide the necessary enormous damage spikes for her needed to get through, especially at Double bonus floors. BR can be picked by F17 as SN really depends on gather because of her single target damage being so weak that she'd rather be hitting everyone at once.

    Breach is an absolute must to get before F7. You'll have to reset the run otherwise. The reason for this is due to SN's massive reliance on Breach as without it her damage plummets really really hard. As for SP Regen, it's not a bad choice due to how much SN halvens Load from her constant UE's, allowing for the Load to get back up to 150 fast enough during every Ultimate's animation if you have 3 of Aponia's Basic signets.

### <p align="center">-- Scamrole!</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.1. Carole arguably sits in a tier of her own thanks to this, and a couple other reasons. While she actually has A LOT of frontloaded damage that hurts a shitton, both in her Charged ATKs and Ultimate, this is however eclipsed by the fact that she's actually TERRIBLE when dealing with the F17 Bosses. This can easily become a problem for you to get past, which would mean a failed run.

    I do not know how Carole performs against Husk, and I don't really want to try it out either. Not gonna deal with the IMG Taint and Husk's bullshit. Honestly, not sure which one between the two is less bullshit for Carole.

##  Difference between Kalpas1 and Kalpas2: 
<p align="center">By: Butter#2252</p>

Kalpas 2 core makes you lose 5k Hp or more to give you a 40% boost from kalpas signets (increases to 8k hp lost and 80% boost from kalpas with 25% bonus hp signet). Any healing you get turns into more hp for the hp cap, meaning more hp for kalpas core two (which can further increase the 80% boost to 100% with hp% signet)

***
##  Difference between Su1 and Su2: 
######<p align="center">**Su 1 vs Su 2 enhanced only**</p>
<p align="center">By: Butter#2252</p>

**Su 1 enhanced signets:**
Maxim of Anitya: enemies hit by karma wheels can not regenerate sheilds for 3 seconds.

Maxim of Anatman: the next attack with in 8 seconds by an enemy hit by karma wheel has that attack lose 50% total damage. 

Maxim of Santam: karma wheels deal 100% bonus damage to  shielded and  500% additional adaptive damage to unshielded enemies.

Maxim of Anitya does not remove shields it just makes the enemy not able to recover them which is only useful against heimdel and that it.  Maxim of Anatman looks good but then you remember that it only affects ONE attack and since most enemies have multi hit moves you are still going to take the full damage of the other oh and this doesn’t work with fu hua core 2 enhanced signet worldly troubles. Maxim of Santam is the only good one as it’s more damage but that’s it.

——————————

**Su 2 enhanced signets:**

Dictum of Anitya: for every debuff in the enemy Bodhi open eye will deal 150% more damage

Dictum of Anatman: Bodhi open eye debuffs last 3 seconds longer and for every debuff on the enemy, they receive 5% more total damage taken from the enemy

Dictum of Santam: Bodhi open eye will apply 3 random debuffs for 3 seconds

Dictum is the king of enemy total damage taken as the trance debuff which is part of the core is a debuff it already means anatman makes them have 5% more. Then santam applies 3 random of the following debuffs (stun, paralyze, Ignite, freeze, impair, weaken, attack slow and move slow) that’s 7 more debuffs! Now anatman and anitya also counts anything that is labeled as a debuff so this includes: Trance, Intoxication (eden 1), weapon skill debuffs, shield shattered (Carole), HoT mark, Analyzed (HoR), Coma (HoS), Immobilized (jailer, AE ult), etc. with all of that said you can see how good Su 2 is with its enhanced than Su 1. Also with all 8 debuffs the enemy has gained 40% more total damage taken. And that’s level 1. At level 3 that’s 64% damage taken.
