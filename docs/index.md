####<p align="center">Announcement</p>

This ER Guide will no longer be maintained and updated by the main and original person in charge (Adori - Columbina Supremacy#6481) from retirement.

<p align="center"> **Note: The number behind the Signet Name represents the core** </p>
<p align="center">**Eg: Aponia2 = Aponia - Signet of Discipline Core 2 (You Shall Receive Disciplines' Blessing)**</p>

<p align="center">The signets are arranged in order of priority</p>

***

Each Difficulty has a noticeable spike and increase in the HP, amidst other things, of the mobs and bosses. This guide does and tests EVERY valk at the maximum Difficulty (Finality, 2.75x) and uses the results of those runs as a reference or measure the strength, potential of a Valkyrie with specific Gears and Ranks. This then also is used as a sort of proof of what the Valkyrie is capable of in the weather in which the video run has been done, or how much clear time you should expect for that valkyrie to do assuming your Valkyrie's Rank, Gears and other impactful buffs (such as Dkey ATK and Dorm Level ATK) are close to or almost equal to the tested run.

You can also use the clear times (do prefer to use the ones for the current patch instead of previous patches) as another measurement of how well the Valkyrie does and also use it as a reference for when you're downscaling (when your Valkyrie's Ranks or Gears are lower/weaker than the tested ones).

- 1D Void = 1.00x
- 2D Shroud = 1.5x
- 3D Inferno = 1.75x
- 4D Submergence = 2x
- 5D Abstinence = 2.25x
- 6D Corruption = 2.5x
- 7D Finality = 2.75x

Clearing Abstinence gives ALL the rewards. 
Corruption additionally gives the FC Emblem that grants 12% TDM and 400 HP when equipped, only applicable to Elysian Realm. This emblem is strongly recommended.
Finality gives nothing, we use it for the purpose of testing the Valkyries' strength and as a reference for downscaled difficulty runs if you need it.

***

**What do these mean?**1

- Yes = At some point get this signet. It doesn't matter when, just that you obtain it, as its a signet needed to make the build work.
- 1st/2nd/etc = Get this 1st/2nd/etc.
- Start = Start with this signet.
- Optional = You can take it at later floors or get them from Felis Shop Signets, as long as you get them in the end.
- Filler = Only consider going for this if the other portals suck.
- No = Don't get this.

## Elysian Realm's 6.2 2nd Half ER Tierlist
<p align="center"> By: Adori - Columbina Supremacy#6481</p>

!!! note
    Please make sure to read the explanation below regarding the method in which the Tierlist was made before DMing me for whatever reason you might want to, thank you~

There are 2 methods used to determine the Valkyries' placement. Also, from Left to Right = Stronger to Weaker.

- Their strength in the current weather and how well they do.

- How well can they downscale (F2P or F2P with some mixed signature gears).

![my-image (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114035701/211171389-393af22d-3018-472b-9f68-ad7b7b3fa037.png)

A lot of factors can go into the strength of a Valkyrie as well. Please keep that in mind, as not every run will have good signet RNG. Gameplay will not always be perfectly optimized. Divine Key ATK, Dorm Level ATK and Dorm Buffs will also always be varying and thus will affect your Valkyrie's DMG. ATK difference is also another factor.

### <p align="center">-- General Build</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.3. AKA is yet another one of these valkyries that needs quite the particular investment for comfily using in ER. She wants a minimum rank of S2, and she also wants her pri-arm, without which she struggles quite noticeably. However, there's also something else that adds up into her performance at ER. She's also a highly difficult mechanical valk to optimally play with, as she does have quite a lot of tricks going for her. Most notably, animation cancels, which arguably do provide quite a big and drastic DPS increase for her, both inside and outside ER.

> Boss to be Chosen: RPC, then Vill-V or Kalpas


####<p align="center">Setup</p>

Rank | Difficulty Done | Recommended Gear | Clear Time | Run
:------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------:
SS0 | Finality | Skadi Pri & 3-set Ana | 10:08m (6.1 1st Half) | [https://youtu.be/8DI2mKbHxNY](https://youtu.be/8DI2mKbHxNY)

!!! danger
    In downscalability terms, she's downright bad below SS rank. At a minimum of S2 rank however, she isn't as bad, but one problem still remains, she needs her signature Pri. With weaker stigmatas, expect her performance to decrease. Choose difficulty accordingly.

Buff | Load
:----: | :----: 
Recover 1 SP per second when HP is full. | 5
Valkyrie deals 15% bonus Total DMG. This effect is negated for 5s after taking DMG. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 10
When enemies are ignited, frozen or time-slowed, the Valkyrie deals 15% more Total DMG for 8s. Triggering it again refreshes its duration. | 10

!!! note
    Effective for 6.3.

Time | Remembrance Sigil | FC Support Skill
:----: | :----: | :----:
Early | Veil of Tears | The Lonely Moon OR Because of You
Mid | Gold Goblet / Forbidden Seed / Rainbow of Absence | Boundless Logos
Late | The First Scale | Boundless Logos

!!! note
    With Willows and assuming same rank (SS), it's possible for AKA to instead start with Because of You and get her 2 Ego signets for F7, which will then open the opportunity to get Boundless Logos by F9.

Time | Support 1 | Support 2
:----: | :----: | :----:
Early | AE | LE
Mid | AE | BK
Late | AE | HB

!!! note
    Remember to switch out LE for BK at F9/F10 before Heimdall fight. As for LE, you can switch her out once you get yourself a SP regen source like Aponia's. HB on the other hand is better after Heimdall fight, as she will provide highest damage. BR is not recommended due to AKA wanting to stay at more than 70% HP.

####<p align="center">Elysia - Signet of ■■</p>

Signet | Priority
------|:----:
**Blessing of Frost Scythe**: Tap [ATK] after evasion to hurl Frost Guisarmier which spins for 5s, gathers enemies nearby, and deal 5400% ATK of Ice DMG. CD: 10s | **Start**

**Blessing of Winter Harvest**: Enemies recovering from Ice Cell are inflicted with 1 stack of Hypothermia | 1st
**Blessing of Cold Moon**: Inflicting Ice Cell also creates a self-centered Frost Ring lasting 6s which deals 180% ATK of Ice DMG per 0.3s to enemies nearby | 2nd
**Blessing of Uranian Mirror**: Burst mode consumes 100% more SP and Valkyrie deals 90% bonus Total DMG in burst mode | No

!!! note
    This build mainly relies on 2 Ego signets with 2 other serving as a huge powerspike: Starting with Frost Scythe + Stellar Trails. Frost Scythe will act as your means of reliable gather, being a strong one at that, and also providing pretty decent amounts of damage on a 8s CD. Be mindful of this to spam it every 8 seconds. The other 2 Ego Signets to get are Winter Harvest + Cold Moon. Do NOT get Uranian Mirror.

####<p align="center">Aponia - Signet of Discipline (1st Core)</p>

!!! note
    Ideal course of build up: 2 Ego start into Aponia SP Regen F3, finish Aponia 2nd Core by F4, go shop F5 and swap The Lonely Moon for Because of You, buy Aponia's Penance if possible, otherwise get Mobius' Lip Poison [E] and Hua's Elem Breach. Can upgrade Aponia's Ultimate. Grab Aponia door F6 for Breach and finish Mobius 1st Core by F7 with Entwined [P] and Rodent [V].

In Penance, the Valkyrie takes 30% less Total DMG and deals 40% more Physical and Elemental DMG to enemies. Valkyrie deals 800% ATK of Adaptive DMG to attacking enemies when hit; CD: 5s. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 2nd

!!! note
    Lip Poison gives a good damage increase to AKA's Crescent Harvest (her Summoned Entity). Dead [X] is also strongly recommended to get as a sharp damage increase for AKA.

####<p align="center">Griseo - Signet of Stars (4th Core)</p>

### <p align="center">-- Dudu becomes a Jojo Fan</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.3. Dudu got her own stand, and she's on her way to become a real Jojo of her own. Truly built different! Will her stand be as powerful as Jojo's Star Platinum? Oh, an enemy is approaching! How dare they approach her? They must be destroyed by Abyss Flower! Wait... it did really destroy them easily. She's... a monster! Anyway, her damage ceiling is astronomically high. She's a pretty straightforward valkyrie that doesn't have much problems clearing it, however, her requirement for this is to have 3-set Dante and AF is a given.

> Boss to be Chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Aponia

SS0 | Finality | Abyss Flower & 3-set Dante | 8:29m (6.3) | [https://youtu.be/h9xdZV3vtZk](https://youtu.be/h9xdZV3vtZk)

!!! danger
    Truthfully, you shouldn't even bother with this Valkyrie if you don't have BOTH of the shit she needs, which is basically AF and 3-set Dante. AF is a given since Hler Serenity is just bad. As for the 3-set Dante? There's just... no replacement for it. Other than maybe coping with 3-set Dirac. But, again, let's be honest... that's, uh, pretty awkward to cope with. BK really needs the impair right from the get go.

**Blessing of Holy Lance**: During Basic ATK SEQ 4, tap [ATK] repeatedly to thrust the lance at enemies in an increasingly violent manner to deal a total of 6000% ATK of Physical DMG, and Valkyrie is immune to frontal and flank attacks. When Valkyrie's SEQ 4 attack reaches its peak, Basic ATK SEQ 5 will be enhanced to deal 3500% ATK of bonus Physical DMG to enemies in a large area | No

    Gambit and Paragon are her must-start signets. Those are the 2 main signets that will carry BK throughout the whole run. A 3rd Ego signet is strongly recommended to get for Glory.

    Ideal course of build up: 3 Ego Start (Gambit + Paragon + Glory) into Hua's TDM or Phys Breach F3, finish Hua 2nd Core, grab Broken Dream F5, go shop F6 and use 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse to get Griseo's Red Paint and Aponia's Ultimate, then finish Aponia 2nd Core by F7 Double.

    Strongly recommended to use 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse for Griseo! Red is highest priority to +3. Yellow also high priority to +3. Getting Grey can be good but you can just end burst earlier, especially with Sakura1's desired signets. Also strongly recommended to get Petals and Fallen Leaves at +2 from 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse and upgrade Fallen Leaves to +3.

### <p align="center">-- Ignition is so fun!</p>

!!! note
    Updated 6.3. Okay, so. Ai-Chan. She's pretty fun, and apparently she makes a really satisfactory sound everytime she deflects her chakrams. Which is kind of interesting for the gameplay itself. She also is comfortable to play due to the good gather that she has, albeit unreliable when the enemies are too far away. But she has some serious problems which will be pointed out below this note.

!!! danger
    Ai-Chan needs S Rank as a bare minimum to be usable in ER. SS will improve her a bit, however her strength is largely tied to being 4/4. What this means is that she has a horrible downscalability, and you can expect this to be made **really clear** once this current shilling weather is gone. If your Ai-Chan does not have even a Pri Chakram to use, and your Stigmas aren't her Idol Set, do not expect her to perform very well.

!!! note 
    In downscaling terms, she's fucking horrible without her gears. Do expect Ai-Chan's strength to drop considerably without her own Signature set, mainly because of how much damage her ignition does and also because of how much fire-related buffs her set gives that other Fire-related sets don't come close to.

    You'll never swap AE out. BR on the other hand can be swapped for BK if needed for Heimdall fight. This is especially recommended due to the usage of Kalpas2 and Ai-Chan lacking good, dependable i-frames alongside being easily interrupted which then makes her really easy to be killed by Heimdall in Red Mode. Without BK, you need good skill through properly evading and making use of her only 2 i-frames in order to get past his Red Mode forcefuly.

!!! note
    Updated 6.2. This build requires JST TM. It's essential in order to make it work. However, it's way stronger and more reliable than Leuweenhoek TB Thales M.

!!! danger
    Ai-Chan needs S Rank as a bare minimum to be usable in ER. SS will improve her a bit, however her strength is largely tied to being 4/4. What this means is that she has a horrible downscalability, and you can expect this to be made **really clear** once this current shilling weather is gone. If your Ai-Chan does not have even a Pri Chakram to use, and your Stigmas aren't her Idol Set, do not expect her to perform very well.

### <p align="center">-- You need some Discipline</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.3. Aponia being one of the strongest Flamechasers available to do ER with, is also a valk that doesn't really demands much mechanical play. There's really not much to explain about her. Aponia in ER is basically a get 100 sp, use Ultimate, hold A for Thunderstorm and move or just watch a video while enemies die. Then gain SP again and repeat the same process. More explanation on her is given in the description of the video runs.

    Yeah. Fighting herself. That's how things should be. Right?

### <p align="center">-- Below SS2 Build</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.3. Do note that FR needs her Pri-arm if you want to use her for ER. Due to the complex mechanics that FR has, she's one of the harder valks to properly play into ER. In fact, much like certain other valks, her performance won't only depend on her gears and ranks, but also will depend on how optimally you can play her. As long as you can consistently and properly do her Evade cancels (especially taking note of Strix-the bird rune- getting off CD to spam him) into Charged ATKs one after another, you can expect things to go well. Her greatest dps is between her ult and the successive Charged ATK chain. 

!!! danger
    This variant sacrifices some early game strength in exchange for enabling FR to dps in ER at below SS2 ranks.

> Boss to be Chosen: Husk, then Aponia or Kosma

!!! note
    Aponia is just easier. Kosma is not recommended due to FR lacking enough hitcount potential which would take her too long during the hitcount phases.

    The 2 must-have for start are Silence and Mixing. Silence is essential since FT doesn't have any damage early on without her Ultimate, it is her main DPS source, her Basic ATK only start hurting in late. Also due to Sleepri active. Mixing provides the much-needed gather that FT wants, especially with the knockback that her attacks have. The other 2 Ego signets needed are Fervor and Thorns. 5th Ego isn't necessary.

### <p align="center">-- General Build</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.3. As far as testing goes, this is the current best build for Eden, and other variations with different signets are either weaker, or just don't really work as well as they would seem to do in paper. Take Eden2 for instance, which supposedly GD would be perfectly fine with. Issue? It actually isn't that great. Only acceptable as a versatile option when you don't have any other better alternatives for doors, but otherwise, not recommended to do as early start, as it's garbage.

    This build requires only 3 Ego signets to function: Arioso + Fugue into Cadenza. You can also additionally take a 4rd Ego door for Concerto, or if you plan on using Eden2, take Symphony, but otherwise NEVER take Symphony, as it heavily relies on minimum 2 SP regen sources (Aponia2 and Eden2).

    Regarding 2 diff Startup importance: Aponia which includes her Boundless Feeling support skill is weaker for F4 Double, but is a bit stronger start after getting her core. Kosma on the other hand provides easily accessible and comfortable gather, while also being stronger for F4 Double and can very likely guarantee it. This run will assume Aponia start.

    Hometown is self-explanatory for +3 Hua signets. If you're struggling though, take The Lonely Moon instead. Afterwards, you can choose to keep it or go with Dreamful Gold (esp for 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse) or stay with Out of Reach. This latter will become a really reliable source of gather.

Early | AE | BR
Mid | AE | BK
Late | AE | BR

!!! note
    AE will be your main means of gather aside of her other bonuses. BR will be your bread and butter necessary to get past Early floors with enough damage. You need to bring BK for Heimdall fight, as Memento REALLY struggles without BK's assistance against Heimdall.

!!! note
    Whiteout and Flourish are the obligatory must-get starter signets. It is recommended to do F2 Ego bald to get Haste as your 3rd Ego signet. Early on it's weak, but it'll scale well towards the late game. If you don't want it, however, you can instead go with Griseo Red Paint.

####<p align="center">Hua - Signet of Vicissitude (1st Core)</p>

!!! note
    Basic ATK is high priority to +3. Whilst not necessary, the Ultimate signet is not a bad idea to get for 2 reasons mainly. One, it will increase the Load per second to 30, which is good to consider for Memento due to the rate at which she halvens Aponia's Load. Second, it will also increase your Ultimate's DMG. However, do note that this will modify your playstyle if you're using 7T.

!!! note 
    Updated 6.3. Memento didn't had enough fun with 7T and thought it was too simple and easy for her, so she got rid of it and decided to go to a back alley, proceeded to buy a 3* weapon of doubtful quality from a merchant by the name of Senti, got back home and chose the highest difficulty to prove she isn't any weaker and can also do it herself. Was it worth the 500,000,000 yen that the 3* weapon cost her? Did she get scammed by Senti? Or does that not matter? Turns out even the highest difficulty couldn't stop her and she became an unstoppable force of nature! What an absolute madlad!

!!! danger
    Do note that the best start for this build is Griseo's Red Paint at F2, so it's strongly recommended to mald for it instead of Ego signet.

### <p align="center">-- Starfire Build</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.3. So far, this is the strongest build. Simple explanation; Starfire is stronger early game, but can fall off a bit later in the game without Reburn and Tempered Warrior, which is also fixed. And then, as a result, you have a stronger general build that's ideally a stronger and perhaps more comfortable start, especially when you have the damage for it.

> Boss to be Chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Aponia or Vill-V.

####<p align="center">Hua - Signet of Vicissitude (1st Core)</p>

    Ideal course of build up: 3 Ego Start (Heatflow + Starfire + Reburn) into Hua Elem Breach F3, finish Hua 2nd Core by F4 Double, grab Broken Dream by F5 Shop, use 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse to get both of Kalpas' DMG boosts or one and one of Sakura's signets and finish Kalpas 2nd Core by F7 Double with 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse

    It's a MUST to use 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse to get Kalpas' signets starting at +2 for this current weather at ALL COSTS. This is obvious, as Kalpas is one of HoFS' unchanged main cores and it's also one of her strongest and biggest powerspikes. Kalpas Enhanceds are unnecessary, focus on other Cores and upgrading Kalpas' DMG boosts and TDM Taken instead.

!!! note
    It's absolutely essential to ensure you get Sakura1 by the time you reach F11 unless you don't get Tempered Warrior by then, as Sakura 1st Core's synergy with Tempered Warrior is what makes this Core really broken on HoFS. As for the SP on UE signet, it's hugely helpful and beneficial due to allowing you to Ult early into your Herrscher Mode start for the purposes of applying Griseo's Yellow paint and Fallen Leaves later once you have them.

!!! note
    Red & Hot is the absolute highest priority to +3. Yellow can also be upgraded to +3 provided you have Sakura's SP on UE signet. One important thing to note here: You'll want to make sure to get Yellow next if you happen to get Fallen Leaves from a Griseo door. Or in the case you get A Flame Extinguished, then pick Yellow over it.

!!! note
    The minimum requirement of Tuna is to have Heatflow and Reburn as her starting signets. Without Reburn, she feels awful to play. Without Heatflow, she doesn't feel like she has much damage. So, a double Ego start is essential for Tuna. Afterwards, getting a 3rd Ego door is very good, taking Tempered Warrior to make the entire run easier and feel better. 4th is also taken for Starfire, adding even more damage but it's not really necessary.

!!! danger
    You leave Kalpas enhanceds for later on. 2 reasons. Getting a Sakura signet or being able to finish Hua 2nd Core by F7 double or even getting Tempered Warrior is higher value. And trying to get one after finishing his 2nd core is a massive slowdown on the pace, as it feels like it's not really doing anything to help u. This is the reason getting other signets instead is better. So, leave this for after you get 2nd core.

!!! note
    I also strongly recommend upgrading Kalpas' Max HP after both of his DMG boosts if you're using Himeko. Himeko M giving 25% max HP paired with Kalpas 40% Max HP from +3 and Pardofelis Max HP signet makes it possible to reach up to 16k or 17k HP which gives Kalpas an absolutely massive scaling on his +3 DMG Boosts. When using Shelley T Himeko M Scott B variation, it's even more of a priority as it reaches up to 22.5k HP.

    Fuji, Koyo and Botan are preferred to pick up from Felis Shop, with Fuji being the absolute first priority, especially when missing Tempered Warrior. Read the danger for further explanation.

!!! danger
    Sakura's Core is not necessary to complete. After getting Fuji, you can proceed to focus on getting Griseo and finishing Sakura 1st core on later floors, particularly after Mech Land. Also, Ayame is good to consider taking for the purposes of getting Yellow applied through early Ultimate so you can get your maximum damage output as soon as possible, however you can also instead pick Eden's Initial/Max SP for this.

!!! note
    Due to HoFS' problem of using Ult right away to apply Yellow, you'll usually want to leave at least one charge of UE for the purposes of being able to reset Overheat meter right after using Ultimate. Also one important thing to note here: You'll want to make sure to get Yellow next if you happen to get Fallen Leaves from a Griseo door. Or in the case you get A Flame Extinguished, then pick Yellow over it.

**Blessing of First Encounter**: Charged ATKs in Herrscher of Human Form pull enemies on both sides of the arrow slightly towards the center. Charged ATKs deal an additional 1200% ATK of Ice DMG. If a Charged ATK hits more than 10 times, enemies take 10% more Total DMG from Charged ATKs for every Nexus Signet owned (cannot stack). | No
**Blessing of First Yearning**: In Herrscher of Human Form, Charged ATK Speed increases by 30% for 5s after triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill. When using Charged ATK, shooting speed continously increases, up to a maximum of 80%. Move Speed while using Charged ATKs increases by 100%. Resets when Charged ATK ends. When Charged ATK hits, Ultimate Evasion CD decreases by 2.5s and weapon skill CD decreases by 1s. Gain 1 stack of Crystal Ice Mirror for every Charged ATK that hits an enemy. Every stack of Crystal Ice Mirror increases DMG from Charged ATK's by 10%. | No

!!! note
    This build is best taken with 3 Ego signets, basically, double reroll is its most ideal start. Bloom + Journey is the startup while Awakening is the 3rd Ego signet taken by F2. Journey is simply 10x times better and far stronger, and the way you use it is save the Crystals (used on Evade mainly) to oneshot a wave, then use Active + Charged for 2nd Wave. Use Finisher early after that and get your 2nd Ult ASAP for another round of Crystals from Journey.

####<p align="center">Griseo - Signet of Stars (1st Core)</p>

!!! note
    Ideal Order from F1-F7: Double Ego Start (Bloom + Journey) into Awakening at F2, get Griseo's Red at F3, finish Griseo 2nd Core by F4 Double with Yellow and Black, then grab Griseo's Petals in the Wind or Fallen leaves F5, go shop F6 and buy Griseo's Blue Paint, use 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse to try and get Kalpas' both TDM and Elem DMG boosts at +3 followed by either Sakura TDM or TDM Taken, or one of Hua or Vill-V's signets. Then grab Griseo door for F7 Double to get the remaining 2 Enhanceds.

Signet | Priority

**Red & Hot**: Using a weapon active taints enemies nearby with red paint for 8s and makes them take 25% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG (cannot stack). Triggering it again resets the duration. | 1st
**Yellow & Warm**: Using an Ultimate taints enemies nearby with yellow paint for 8s and makes them take 30% bonus Total DMG. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 2nd

**Petals in the Wind**: When red and blue taint triggers Blending, enemies within 8m are dealt 1200%/500% ATK of Adaptive DMG; CD: 3s. Also taints yourself purple for 15s, increasing the effect of red, yellow, and blue taint by 40%. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 1st
**Fallen Leaves**: When yellow and blue taint triggers Blending along with an AoE ATK dealing 800% ATK of Adaptive DMG; CD: 3s. Also taints yourself green for 15s, increasing Total DMG 20% for each taint in Faded Stars. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 2nd
**A Flame Extinguished**: When red and yellow taint triggers Blending you become tainted orange for 15s, triggering Time Fracture for 2.5s and reducing enemy Physical Defense 40% and Elemental Resist 15% for 10s; CD: 7s. Triggering it again resets the duration. | Filler

!!! note 
    Red is the absolute highest priority to +3. Yellow +3 is also good, you can keep refreshing it through ending Ult early, if you don't want to, you can take Grey. You can also go for the 3* Remembrance Sigil abuse in order to maximize your gains with Griseo and get +3 on all of her signets, making it maximum stonks. A Flame Extinguished is not necessary due to excess breach, but can be taken for stronger Fallen Leaves and more damage.

!!! note 
    Although Puppetry will give excess breach, it's still recommended due to extending the Time Fracture to abuse Drama's additional TDT. Thus, in this case, Drama is the highest priority to +3 and Puppetry is ignored.

    Please do note that normally, Vill-V would also be included in Ballista build. However, specifically for the F2P Run using CoC & Scott TM Rasp B, I haven't used Vill-V at all, with the reason being playing around charging V-V support skill being a bit hard to play around properly alongside its buffs and the fact that if it's not DoEgo, HoE doesn't have 3 Actives instead of 2. In better geared runs, this build will use Vill-V.

!!! note 
    HoH's downscalability is amazing, as she can still perform well even on poverty gears like CoC and Scott TM Rasp B. However, for this current weather, it's recommended to put something better due to the slight nerf to HoH's strength.

BR also has the added benefit of simply granting you way better chances at clearing through the early floors and even the remainder of the run as easily as possible.

!!! note
    Pick Boundless Feeling when your HoS is strong enough to not have problems clearing F4 Double (Aponia's Ultimate signet at F3 for the best chances at doing this) so you get the value from +1 to all Aponia signets picked. Otherwise, go with The Lonely Moon and make sure to time it for instantly clearing Wave 2.

**Red & Hot**: Using a weapon active taints enemies nearby with red paint for 8s and makes them take 25% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG (cannot stack). Triggering it again resets the duration. | 1st

!!! note
    The moment you get any of the basic paints from Griseo, the gameplay changes. It's essential to save the wep active and UE skill to time them together with her Ultimate. Taint Extension is also very crucial for this, as the +0 alone will increase the duration from 8s to 13s, making up for an entire ult duration of 2 complete series of Victory Slashes.

### <p align="center">-- HoS - Ego Mobius Build</p>

!!! note
    Updated 6.3. If you're curious about the reason why this build is one of the less popular builds, it's simply because of the high investment that it demands in terms of Ego signets required. To begin with, while it requires the Ego (Clone) signet in order to start being used, it meant that Dark Plumes had to be left out. No SP Regen and free 30% TDM Taken was just bad. That was the weakness of this build; it just was hard to sustain and took too long to come online into the game.

> Boss to be Chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Elysia, Vill-V or Aponia

!!! note
    Mysticism is a rather tough nut to crack. HoS needs heavy investment into Griseo2 aside from having her other 3 main Cores already finished. What this means is that you might be lacking on the necessary damage to finish Mysticism off before he goes into his ~~bullshit~~ balls phase. Do make sure to save your supports for that phase, if you can.

!!! note
    Two things to note here. SA can be your staple first support for the entire run, or you can swap her for SS later by F6 and above. SS is just stronger due to the 35% Phys Taken, but otherwise her buff is only for 1 wave, which means she loses against SA in terms of mobbing floors, but destroys her on Bossing floors. Second, you really want to bring BK into Heimdall, as HoS struggles against him.

!!! note
    Victory + Dark Plumes are the starting signets, followed by obligatory F2 bald for Ego door, as this build requires the signet of Ego (clone) to enable Mobius to be used. You can then choose to pick either Legion or Supremacy later during the run, but they are unnecessary.

**Newborn [X]**: Triggering Mind Sync again during Mind Sync no longer resets the duration but extends the duration by 4.0s instead. With any summoned entity present, the duration is extended by 5s additionally. | Optional 2nd

!!! note
    Dead [X] is absolute highest priority to +3 as early as possible (F6 Shop). Always keep Mind Sync alive by using your Combos to summon the Clone. Lodging and Unknown [X] are a good combo, don't ignore it in case you get bad RNG at some floor and the other 2 doors are useless!

!!! note
    Red is highest priority to +3. Yellow is good to +3 when you have Grey. Be mindful of adjusting your gameplay around Griseo's paints: this doesn't matter in mobbing floors, but for Bossing floors, you want to save your Active into halfway your 1st Combo (you wanna get your SP for ulting ASAP) and your UE Clone for proccing Blue paint. Basically, you ideally want to have all 3 paints applied in roughly the same window so that they last for an entire Burst duration.

    The moment you get any of the basic paints from Griseo, the gameplay changes. It's essential to save the wep active and UE skill to time them together with her Ultimate.

### <p align="center">-- 4-5 Revived Build</p>

!!! note
    Updated 6.3. This is the 3rd strongest build, and also competes with the others in being the most braindead to play... sort of. The strength of this build is that it is very solid and has damage on everything. 4-5, 7T actives, Dragon slam, Finisher, Shinzan. Overall, it's pretty good.

!!! danger
    Do note though, that this build is not recommended if your HoT is not S1+. Narukami Finisher is stronger.

!!! note 
    This build's downscalability in terms of weapon and stigmatas has yet to be tested. I cannot say yet how it will do without 7T and Handel, especially 7T as it's what makes this build work, and Handel offers a massive damage boost compared to Benares Awakening or other cope stigmatas. However, if you do have them, even if underleveled, then you can downscale accordingly.

!!! note
    As one of the stronger Herrschers in ER, HoV has a rather interesting and unique downscalability, with 3-set Elysia being her 2nd BiS. If not 3-set, Elysia M or SirinA M is strongly recommended. It's also strongly recommended to have Keys of Void or the Pri-version if you want to use HoV in ER. It won't be fun otherwise.

!!! note
    Innateness and Coleus are a must for HoV. It's very strongly recommended to bald for F2 Ego Start in order to get your 3rd Ego signet, Virtuality, as it gives a really strong free 40% TDM Taken. Annihilation is optional but only towards the Late Floors as it is largely useless until you have 3 Cores finished.

!!! note
    It's very recommended to use 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse to get Sakura's TDM signets at +2. Fuji is very important too, because as long as you have either SirinA M or Elysia M, it enables HoV the ability to Evade-Cheese with her Time Bubble and eliminating the requirement of waiting 1 second during her DPS sequence due to Innateness' CD reductions.

### <p align="center">-- DMG Reduction? Where?</p>

!!! note
    Updated for 6.3. Honestly, this is a really fun and genuine surprise that I wasn't expecting to hit this strong. Who would've thought that non-Linnaeus Mobius would be so damn strong nonetheless? Clearly, she doesn't need it, and neither does she gives a fuck about having DMG Reduction trying to weigh her down.

> Boss to be Chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Vill-V or Aponia

!!! note
    The choice between Andrius or Husk is difficult. Andrius has a really thick shield for non-fire Valkyries, making the fight harder even for Mobius. Husk on the other hand can be easier despite the type-counter. Vill-V is the best choice easily if you have Miniature [X] available.

    Boundless Logos is a given. It is not swapped out due to the brutal efficiency in which Mobius can abuse it. However, when it's low on charge by the time you go into Shop, then you can consider swapping it out in order to abuse the 3* Remembrance Sigil gamble.

    Due to the existing Load Buff granting 10 SP per 60 SP restored, Mobius can make really good use out of BR right away from the start. Once this is gone, however, LE is used instead unless you're otherwise missing damage in which case BR is the best choice to go here. Remember to bring BK for Heimdall fight.

    Dead [X]'s impact is mainly from being a ramping up buff, so it's not so much of a problem to not get it early on, meanwhile Unknown [X] is a good choice to take in case you don't manage to get Dead [X]. Also, Dead [X] is really high priority to upgrade to +3.

### <p align="center">-- Unlimited Blade Works Build - Aponia Variation</p>

!!! note 
    Updated for 6.3. This build basically focuses on A spam. It's her strongest general build, taking into account ranks, downscaling and weather-related buffs & debuffs. On the other hand, however, it is heavily reliant on gather. The strongest variation of Sussy's UBW build, which fully utilizes Aponia signets' strength alongside Griseo, resulting in a really deadly and strong as fuck build that melts through enemies easily like a rain of millions of knives going through butter.

> Boss to be Chosen: RPC, then Elysia, Mobius, Aponia or Vill-V

### <p align="center">-- Dash ATK Build</p>

!!! note 
    Updated for 6.1. This build focuses basically on B Spam. As a warning, this build is a bit more limited in usage, as it requires your Sushang to be strong enough as to have damage overflow, due to B spam consuming Blade Mantra. It can potentially beat or contest strongly with A spam build. It's also not gather-reliant.

> Boss to be Chosen: Hephaestus, then Vill-V, Mobius or Aponia

!!! note
    You only consider Mobius if you have a reliable gather for the Miniature [X] dolls.

### <p align="center">-- Guardian Form Build</p>

!!! note
    Updated to 6.3. This build is far stronger, superior and easier compared to Gallop build. Guardian Form has a natural close-quarters gather. Anyone that's on her screen at the moment of using her Charged ATK will be gathered in front of her Severance. It also has a big AoE that hits every one of these mobs. And since the 1800% DMG explosion from it has a delay, it means that if the wave was killed by the downward attack, then the next wave will be damaged by Severance and be impaired already, giving it a edge on potential DPS.

### <p align="center">-- Knight Form Build</p>

!!! note
    Updated to 6.3. Okay, so, for gameplay purposes. There are a few things to be noted that need to be clear. Unlike Guardian Form, this build has a rather annoying and glaring weakness. It's very dependant on gather. Since this build is focused on single-target damage due to the nature of how PE's Charged ATK works, you need gather. And then, make sure your Charged ATK is hitting ALL gathered enemies. While it's possible for PE to reposition herself during the Charge so that she can control the direction where the Charge will go, this is very important to micromanage in order to actually make sure you're not wasting your DPS potential. This is important especially for Double Bonus floors if you want to make sure you'll get them.

!!! note
    SN and SS are your staple supports during almost all the run. SN not only provides an useful gather on a 30s CD but also 15% TDM. BR is not recommended due to making use of the 1 Sp/s Load. SA can be used instead, but in exchange for 50s CD. For Heimdall, make sure to bring BK. Then, for Husk Mysticism fight, you can swap SN out for BR.

Late | Tin Flask or Key to the Deep | Falling in Past Light

!!! note
    Because Of You is best taken by F5 shop: as early as possible, and it's only if you want to secure getting Midnight (see Ego signet section for more info). The Lonely Moon or Falling in Past Light as start depends on your preference; FPL preferred if you want to take the V-V start route, TLM for Aponia start route.

:----: | :----: | :----:
Early | AE | BR
Mid | AE | BR or BK
Late | AE | BR

!!! note
    You'll want to prioritize saving AE for gather sometimes if you are lacking in a ELF that has gather or while you don't have Vill-V's 2nd Core unlocked, as Fischl is straight up horrible without it. She's literally dependant on it due to her almost non-existent AoE damage, especially when lacking 3rd signet which is pretty much a requirement.

!!! note
    BKE is only for the purposes of filling Heimdall's Heavy Trauma Bar, forcefully ending his Red Mode.

####<p align="center">Elysia - Signet of ■■</p>

Signet | Priority
------|:----:
**Blessing of Retribution**: Grants 1 stack of Blessing of Retribution every 7s. 2 stacks max. QTE consumes 1 stack to create a small lightning field which lasts 2s and deals 3x225% ATK of Lightning DMG per 0.4s to enemies within. Starts with 2 stacks | **Start**
**Blessing of Fate**: When hitting an enemy weakspot with a weapon active, Oz unleashes dark lightning to deal 2000% ATK of Lightning DMG | 1st
**Blessing of Midnight**: During Ultimate, Oz lingers on for 7s after the arrow rain. Every 7 hits from Oz on enemies within the Ultimate range summons dark lightning to deal 1500% ATK of Lightning DMG | 2nd
**Blessing of Nightfall**: Weapon actives deal 200% bonus Total DMG. Summoning Oz with Charged ATK or casting Ultimate refills 2 weapon active charges | No
**Blessing of Dark Wings**: When Ultimate Evasion Skill is triggered, Oz unleashes dark lightning to deal 4200% ATK of Lightning DMG | No

!!! note
    Fischl requires 3 Ego signets: Retribution into Fate start, then Midnight. 3rd Ego signet is a MUST because Fischl's personal and AoE damage is genuinely horrible without Midnight. It forms such a big part of her build here in ER that Fischl without any of these 3 signets becomes one of the weakest and most dogshit ER valks in the game. As such, Because of You is recommended to secure this.

!!! danger
    This build has 2 different startups to note: We're gonna assume V-V start. Aponia start is slightly stronger, but V-V start is more comfortable and preferred if you don't have any ELF that provides gather or don't want to bother too much resetting for spawn RNG and maintaining enemies in the circle for Retribution. That's the only importance of choice; whether you choose one or the other, their order of priority is just swapped up between them. (Aponia 1st, V-V 2nd) 

####<p align="center">Vill-V - Signet of Helix (1st Core)</p>

    Ideal course of build up: 2/3 Ego Start, finish V-V 2nd Core by F4 or F6, shop at F5, then either finish Aponia 2nd Core by F7 or grab V-V2's both Drama and Puppetry. For Aponia2, grab both the Breach and TDM Taken

    Fischl has no in-built healing, and due to the usage of BR, she doesn't need Kalpas cores. Instead, only aim for Kalpas' both DMG boosts and Max HP. Preferred to take from Felis Shop basically.

**Newborn [X]**: Triggering Mind Sync again during Mind Sync no longer resets the duration but extends the duration by 4.0s instead. With any summoned entity present, the duration is extended by 5s additionally. | 2nd, YES

!!! note
    Mobius is REALLY high priority to finish and get both Dead [X] and Newborn [X]. The reason is because of the way Oz works. Oz stays in field way too long, and Fischl's only means of recasting Oz to naturally refresh Mind Sync's duration is through the signet of Nightfall or through Ultimate Cast. This makes Newborn [X] as VERY essential and must-take alongside Dead [X]. Basically, Dead [X] won't be useful for long without Newborn [X] present.

Signet | Priority
------|:----:
**Blessing of Hidden Claws**: When Combo ATK/Paw Barrage/Predation hits, the target drops 5 Shiny Silvers. It has 5 charges, which reset every floor (unaffected by other effects). It also increases Ice DMG by 45% for 10s. Triggering it again resets the duration | **Start**

!!! note
    Double Ego start is not necessary, Phantasma will just further make it easier.

    An very important thing to note here, if you don't have Purana, you shouldn't be taking Cat's Eyes at all. Purana is essential in that just by having it, you can then ignore Tailpiece. However, if you don't have it, as you'll be missing the 30% CD reduction on ultimate, you need Tailpiece because otherwise your ult will be on CD and Runaway state will run out. Tailpiece helps negate this.

You can then proceed to use F7 Double to finish the Core with 1 Signet, preferentially Kalpas or Pardo, otherwise Vill-V

### <p align="center">-- (Pardo2) Weakest Flamechaser my ass!</p>

!!! note
    Updated 6.3. SW is very straightforward. And a bit clunky too, but otherwise a strong non-Herrscher valkyrie for ER. However, I can't attest for her strength with downscaled gears. She's reliant on her signature weapon, and her own signature stigmata set provides too much stuff that she does utilize very well while other alternatives are sort of lacking. Nevermind Ana.

### <p align="center">-- Rita's Training Arc 7D</p>

!!! note
    Updated 6.3. SpA had enough of sitting in the bench just warming it while watching other valkyries push ahead of her, so she decided to finally take matters into her hands and train to become a better valkyrie and catch up to the others! And she sure did went a bit overboard... by becoming even stronger than before! SpA's strength in favorable weathers is pretty strong and she also becomes a fairly easy valk to clear ER with. Although she struggles even more against Psy mobs. 


>   Boss to be chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Aponia or Vill-V

!!! note
    You should consider Hephaestus' Overheat mechanic. You might not be able to kill him. If you're not confident in doing so, you can instead go with Husk, but he's more annoying due to SpA's lack of i-frames which makes her be reliant on manual dodging even more, as she already uses Kosma.

    Updated 6.3. This valk is fucking awful. Honest truth. Her early game absolutely sucks, even as SS-rank, and loses against valks like Fischl and Eden in that regard. She only starts ramping up in strength after Benares, but even then, she still sucks a bit as she becomes mediocre at best. If anything, I would honestly recommend to play other valks instead of this shitty valk. She just really sucks, nothing more.

### <p align="center">-- Veliona Tries to Survive</p>

!!! note
    Updated 6.3. Nyx is a sort of straightforward valkyrie to play in ER. Relying on the generation of Carmine Gashes to recover SP for herself and get ready to ult everytime, she actually has a quite comfortable downtime. However, this is locked behind the requirement of needing one of her Ego signets. For a full explanation, you can read the video run's description.

>   Boss to be chosen: RPC, then Vill-V or Aponia

!!! note
    Nyx might struggle finishing Aponia off before she goes flying in her P2. If u want faster clear time, V-V is the choice.

!!! note
    Nyx as a whole can be assumed to be very screwed with downscaled gear, as her strength early on is on the weak side. Not only her own signature weapon helps her a lot, but also other stigmata choices lose out on more than 20% DPS comparison to Verne. Simply speaking, for downscalability purposes, expect this valk to be more affected the worse the gears are.

!!! note
    Most of Griseo's damage comes specifically from her bleed, and also from her main damage Ego signet's damage being counted as Bleeding DMG. This basically means, that although Griseo is still good with F2P signets (Elysia TB), the worse the stigs are, the worse she'll perform. This can be overcome to some extent by a maxed Elysian Astra. But also this means that 2-set Cezanne as a bare minimum will make Griseo's performance skyrocket.

Provided you actually wouldn't mind balding for making this valkyrie work, that is... Wait, this valk actually isn't that bad! Okay, but seriously. What can I say? StFu's strength as a valkyrie for ER is also pretty mid, but leaning towards somewhat strong. Though this comes with quite a number of downsides that StFu has, naturally making her not a better choice than other particular valks.

### <p align="center">-- Scamrole!</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.3. Carole arguably sits in a tier of her own thanks to this, and a couple other reasons. While she actually has A LOT of frontloaded damage that hurts a shitton, both in her Charged ATKs and Ultimate, this is however eclipsed by the fact that she's actually TERRIBLE when dealing with the F17 Bosses. This can easily become a problem for you to get past, which would mean a failed run.

    It's important to note here that the 2nd Ego signet that you'll choose depends on whether or not you have Uriel or An Utu. With Uriel, your VK should be strong enough to have so much damage overflow that simply getting Wild Flare will be enough for the entirety of the remainder of the run. However, if you either don't have it, or you want the comfortable option, you can just take Burning Flow and later on if you do get a 3rd Ego door, take Wild Flare. Additionally, if your pick is Wild Flare, then Burning Flow becomes a good 3rd Ego signet to take if you get a 3rd Ego door later in your run.

**Nexus Signet 2: Empty Illusions, Empty Fantasies** |

!!! note
    Pardofelis is an alternative if you don't want to invest too much into Griseo's Core. If you do manage to unlock Pardo's Core, the choice between either will depend. Go 1st if you have at least 500 coins that you're not going to spend. If you have coins to spend otherwise, then go 2nd Core.

### <p align="center">-- Charged ATK Spam Build</p>

!!! note
    Updated 6.3. Not enjoying the Ultimate build perhaps, are we? Maybe because of its reliance on gather in order to unga bunga your way through every floor's waves and waves of mobs coming up to try and stop you?  Or.. maybe you just want to have some fun with Charged Build together with its... ahem... quite horrible and uncomfortable at times, gather signet and Charged ATKs on steroids?

>   Boss to be chosen: Husk Mysticism, then Vill-V or Elysia (to booli her)

####<p align="center">Setup</p>

Rank | Difficulty Done | Recommended Gear | Clear Time | Run
:----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----:
S3 | Finality | Shuhadaku of Uriel & Ragna TB Thales M | 4:55m (6.2 1st Half) | [https://youtu.be/bVrev_CfDdA](https://youtu.be/bVrev_CfDdA)
SS | Finality | Cleaver of Shamash & Wang Zhaojun | 11:09m (6.2 1st Half) | [https://youtu.be/en2-SpYMwDM](https://youtu.be/en2-SpYMwDM)


!!! note
    For Charged Build, these are her BiS stigmas. Other than that, VK's downscalability is really good, since she has a lot of good Stigma alternatives, with LWH TB Thales M being her best F2P craftable stigs. She also doesn't lose in weapon options, with Blood Dance being her BiS F2P weapon (obtainable from Exchange Shop).

####<p align="center">Elysia - Signet of ■■</p>

Signet | Priority
------|:----:
**Blessing of Blaze**: Charged ATK is cast faster, deals 80% more Fire DMG, and produces less Heat. | **Start**
**Blessing of Sharp Flames**: Charged ATK's Schielhau deals an extra 600 + 800% ATK of Fire DMG. Charged ATK SEQ 1 pulls surrounding enemies, CD: 3s. | **1st**
**Blessing of Wild Flare**: When losing HP or casting Charged ATK, inflict Vulnerability on all enemies, which makes them receive 10% more Fire DMG for 10s. It can stack 5 times and it has a CD of 0.5s. It also shortens user's Weapon Active CD by 3s. | **Optional 2nd**
**Blessing of Fiery Mind**: Each hit of Ultimate deals an extra 600% ATK of Fire DMG. Casting Ultimate costs 10% HP, but if HP is below 18%, it is restored to 18%. Ultimate is cast faster and only its SEQ 1 is performed, which will auto-connect into its SEQ 2 whenever having been performed 4 times. | No
**Blessing of Burning Flow**: Evasion can be connected into Guren Flash. Guren Flash is cast faster and restores 20 SP. Within 10s of triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill, Total DMG increases by 40%. Triggering it again refreshes the duration. | No

!!! note
    Only 2 Ego signets are needed for this build: Blaze + Sharp Flames. If you get a 3rd Ego door, it's strongly recommended to take it for Wild Flare because it activates with Chargeds as well, and it also synergizes very well with Uriel. The Fire DMG Vulnerability that it provides is also quite literally one of the strongest buffs you can get for VK.

####<p align="center">Aponia - Signet of Discipline (1st Core)</p>

!!! note
    Ideal course of build up: 2 Ego start (Blaze + Sharp Flames) into Aponia Basic ATK F3, finish Aponia 2nd Core by F4, grab Aponia's Breach F5 and go Shop F6, buy Griseo's Yellow and either Kalpas' TDM and Phys/Elem DMG or Hua's TDM and Elem Breach. Can additionally just get 2 of them and upgrade Aponia's Basic ATK. Then go Aponia Door F7 for remaining Enhanceds

Signet | Priority
- | :----:
**First, No Betrayal**: Exhortation increases by 5 per second and caps at 200. Basic ATK's Total DMG increases by 0.3% of Exhortation. Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill reduces 50% Exhortation. | 1st
**Fifth, No Falsehood**: Valkyrie starts with 70 bonus Exhortation. Whenever Exhortation is reduced, enemies take 25% bonus Total DMG for 5s. Can be refreshed. | 2nd
**Fourth, No Insolence**: Exhortation increases by 5 per second and caps at 200. Ultimate's Physical and Elemental DMG increases by 0.3% of of Exhortation. Using weapon skills reduces 50% Exhortation. | 3rd
**Nexus Signet 2: You Shall Receive Disciplines' Blessing** |
**You Shall Follow Good**: You Shall Know Your Sins' Total DMG dealt increases 40% and increases Physical and Elemental Breach by 0.25% of Exhortation for 6s upon hitting an enemy. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 1st
**You Shall Answer Prayers**: Triggering You Shall Know Your Sins causes the Valkyrie to enter Penance for 8s. In Penance, the Valkyrie takes 30% less Total DMG and deals 40% more Physical and Elemental DMG to enemies. Valkyrie deals 800% ATK of Adaptive DMG to attacking enemies when hit; CD: 5s. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 2nd
**You Shall Punish Evil**: Enemies struck by You Shall Know Your Sins two or more times take 40% more Total DMG. 5 SP is restored when these enemies are hit by You Shall Know Your Sins. | 3rd

!!! note
    Basic ATK is highest priority to +3. This is the 3rd powerspike that VK gets in this build.

####<p align="center">Kalpas - Signet of Decimation (2nd Core)</p>

!!! note
    Ideal course of build up: 2 Ego start (Blaze + Sharp Flames) into Kalpas' TDM F3, finish Kalpas 2nd Core by F4 with Phys/Elem DMG and Max HP%, go shop F5 and use 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse to grab Hua's Elem Breach and TDM at +2 and Aponia's Basic ATK and 70 Initial Load or just Basic ATK, grab F6 door to either complete Hua 2nd Core or Aponia 2nd Core, then complete the remaining core between both by F7 Double

Signet | Priority
- | :----:
**Blade, Grave and Scar**: Every 100 HP loss boosts Total DMG by 1.0%. | 1st
**Bone, Blood and Ribbon**: Every 100 HP loss boosts Physical & Elemental DMG by 0.8%. | 2nd
**Path, Misfortune and Written Fate**: Max HP increases by 25%. | 3rd
**Desireless, Mindless and Homeless**: Losing HP boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 25% for 8s. | 4th
**Nexus Signet 2: Soldiers, Scissors, Spoils, and Slaughter** |

!!! note
    Getting Kalpas' basic signets at +3 is the best start VK can get. Once she gets the Core done, that's literally her powerspike.

####<p align="center">Griseo - Signet of Stars (3rd Core)</p>

Signet | Priority
------ | :----:
**Red & Hot**: Using a weapon active taints enemies nearby with red paint for 8s and makes them take 25% bonus Physical and Elemental MG (cannot stack). Triggering it again resets the duration | 1st
**Black & Dark**: Every time an enemy is tainted, Valkyries deals 10% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG for 20s. 6 stacks max. | 2nd

**Blue & Cold**: Triggering an Ultimate Evasion Skill taints enemies nearby with blue paint for 8s and reduces their Total DMG and Move Speed by 30%. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 5th
**Nexus Signet 2: Faded Stars** | Not Necessary
**Petals in the Wind**: When red and blue taint triggers Blending, enemies within 8m are dealt 1200%/500% ATK of Adaptive DMG; CD: 3s. Also taints yourself purple for 15s, increasing the effect of red, yellow, and blue taint by 40%. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 1st

!!! note
    Red is highest priority to +3, especially if you have Uriel. You can re-apply Red paint to new waves by using Uriel's 2nd Active so keep that in mind. Finishing Griseo 2nd Core is not that big of a priority, as you can shift your focus to Pardofelis instead.

####<p align="center">Hua - Signet of Vicissitude (4th Core)</p>

Signet | Priority
----| :----:
**Old Dreams Again**: Elemental Breach increases by 0.6% per second | 1st
**Long Trip**: Total DMG increases by 1.0% per second. 40 stacks max. Taking DMG reduces 10 stacks | 2nd
**Dark Garb No More**: Elemental DMG increases by 0.8% per second | 3rd
**Nexus Signet 2: Suffering Mass** |
**Broken Dream**: When possessing Soldier's Remembrance., increase the maximum stack of normal Vicissitude signets by 20 | Optional

!!! note
    Broken Dream is good to consider gambling for.

####<p align="center">Pardofelis - Signet of Reverie (5th Core)</p>

---- | :----:
**Neighborhood Chatters**: Every 100 Shiny Silvers obtained this round boost max HP by 25 and max SP by 1. | 1st

!!! note
    Pardofelis is an alternative if you don't want to invest too much into Griseo's Core. If you do manage to unlock Pardo's Core, the choice between either will depend. Go 1st if you have at least 500 coins that you're not going to spend. If you have coins to spend otherwise, then go 2nd Core.

## Explanations 

### <p align="center">-- 3* Remembrance Sigil Abuse "Cheatcode":

This is a trick that I've started implementing at some point from one of my runs. The reason is because, if successful, it further increases your chances at being able to clear your run successfully, and can even shorten your clear time by improving it in a noticeable way compared to how it would go in a normal run without making use of this trick. 

So, what's it about? Basically, you replace both your **General** and **Support** Remembrance Sigils for the 3* Star ones of the desired FC's signets of choice. As an example, here's Griseo's 3* Star Remembrance Sigil together with her own Support Skill.

![Autodesk Flow Design 2022 12 29 - 21 25 47 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114035701/210026345-b2dceb34-e3a0-4a6b-8ed1-adf7ca6ca493.gif)

This is an intended design. Every one of the FC's 3* Star Remembrance Sigils aside from their own Support Skills give an additional +1 starting level to the signets picked or shown at Felis Shop (Only when you reroll at the moment of having them equipped) as shown in their descriptions.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114035701/210024362-0efb7658-b1e2-4b01-aada-55924eab7c78.png)

It's very simple, but the core of it basically relies on having good luck with the RNG at the moment of rerolling for signets at Felis Shop. It's still, however, a very strongly recommended gamble to do in every one of your runs WITH the exception of when your money is running low or when the cost for rerolling the Shop signets is already at 160 at which point you drop it off.

With both 3* Star Remembrance Sigils, you can get the desired FC signets starting at +2 once they appear in Felis Shop from a reroll.

![Autodesk Flow Design 2022 12 29 - 21 37 26 03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114035701/210024520-ea0aa54a-eddd-4251-95a2-ed52db1280c4.gif)

This also works with Doors, and it's especially recommended to gamble for this for the Double Floors, even more so if you've already unlocked that FC's Core and it has at least 2 Enhanceds that are **priority** to get and very **desirable** to get at increased upgrade levels. Another good reason is that, by design, even when in the current weather the FC's signets get a +2 level on choosing them, this **only** applies to the Basic Signets, not the Enhanceds.

![Autodesk Flow Design 2022 12 29 - 22 02 03 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114035701/210024817-a737c485-64eb-46d6-8a21-fd2c40fc9082.gif)

Additionally, Herrscher of Humanity can also further abuse this. Since she already passively gets +1 starting level to every FC signet picked, having both 3* Remembrance Sigils of a FC will make that FC's signets to start at the max +3 level instead of the normal +2. HoH's cheat doesn't apply to Enhanceds however.

![Autodesk Flow Design 2022 12 29 - 22 11 35 07 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114035701/210025263-a656fdbc-9131-47a8-a680-2ff867af7f0b.gif)
