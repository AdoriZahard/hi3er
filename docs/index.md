<p align="center">**Note: The number behind the Signet Name represents the core**</p>
<p align="center">**Eg: Su2 = Su - Signet of Bodhi Core 2 (Dictum of Bodhi)**</p>

<p align="center">The signets are arranged in order of priority</p>

**Spina Astera and Elysia is under works, as well as the 2-core Raven build and Gunlace Palatinus Meme build**

Difficulties have changed and here are their values:

- 1D Void = 90D
- 2D Shroud = 100D
- 3D Inferno = 110D
- 4D Submergence = 120D
- 5D Abstinence = 130D
- 6D Corruption = 140D
- 7D Finality = 150D

Please note that this is only true for there reward scores, and not the actual previous difficulties pre v5.6

**What do these mean?**

- Yes = At some point get this signet. It doesn't matter when, just that you obtain it, as its a signet needed to make the build work.
- 1st/2nd/etc = Get this 1st/2nd/etc
- Start = Start with this signet
- Optional = You can take it, but not necessary (mostly if your stigmatas' are bad)
- Filler = Only consider going for this if the other portals suck.
- No = Don't get this.

    This build is downscaleable with lower clear time based on stats/gears/rank and lower difficulties. Double Clear is not necessary but is nice, you can perfectly clear with this build, especially in 6.0 weather. The one important thing to note from this build is that, especially if you're downscaling in gears but not on difficulty, you want to learn to time The Lonely Moon perfectly into clearing a new wave of mobs right away. Even 1 or 2 seconds later is still fine. Griseo's skill is monstruously op when used this way, due to how easily it can delete waves instantly and apply all your unlocked paints if they're somehow alive still.

## -- Thanos Snap - *Mobius Build 7D*

!!! note
    Updated for 6.0. Strength has been lowered a bit, but otherwise she can still clear.

> Boss to be Chosen: Husk, then Elysia or Aponia

###<p align="center">Setup</p>

Rank | Difficulty Done | Recommended Gear | Clear Time | Run
:----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----:
SSS | Finality | DoV & 3-set Elysia | 6:35m (2nd Half 5.9) | https://youtu.be/CWRlBghJpEY
SSS | Finality | DoV & 3-set Sirin Ascendant | 6:19m (2nd Half 5.9) | https://youtu.be/WiYxHfdwHnQ
SSS | Finality | DoV & 3-set Mich TB Polo M | 9:53m (2nd Half 5.9) | https://youtu.be/5iB58b-fAQQ
S3 | Finality | Lv55 DoV & 3-set Elysia | 10:08m (6.0) | https://youtu.be/WkSisfkTyA0

!!! danger
    These above are listed based on their potential strength. First listed is the strongest. Wondering why 3-set Elysia is stronger? Run was done with 88 less attack in comparison to Sirin Ascendant. Also, watch out for builds without SirinA M or Elysia M, as the playstyle changes a bit.

!!! note
    This build is downscaleable with lower clear times and lower gear requirement. You don't necessarily have to do Finality, as such, with lower difficulties, you'll either have faster, about the same or lower clear time depending on your gear requirement. However, do note that this valkyrie requires at least Keys of Void to be played in ER. Without her signature weapon, she can't stay in permanent Herrscher Mode.

Buff | Load
:----: | :----: 
Time slowed enemies take 8% bonus Total DMG for 4s. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 5
Using a Weapon Active increases Valkyrie Total DMG by 15% for 5s. Triggering it again resets the duration.| 10
When Valkyrie enters Herrscher Form, all enemies on the field takes 20% more Total DMG (cannot stack) until the current floor ends. | 15

!!! note
    Effective for 6.0.

Time | Remembrance Sigil | FC Support Skill
:----: | :----: | :----:
Early | Forbidden Seed | Falling in Past Light or Tsukimi Himiko
Mid | Pseudo Miracle / Memory / Forget-Me-Not / Home Lost | Falling in Past Light or Tsukimi Himiko

Time | Support 1 | Support 2
:----: | :----: | :----:
Early | VC | BR or SS
Mid | VC | BR or SS
Late | VC | BR or SS

!!! note
    You can instead take SS if you don't like low HP gameplay & want to play safe as HoV can die without Hua shield. This also impacts into the choice of cores, further explained below.

###<p align="center">Elysia - Signet of ■■</p>


Signet | Priority
------|:----:
**Blessing of Law**: Aerial explosion triggered after Ultimate ends deal 2000% ATK of Physical DMG. Gain Spatial Silence stacks after summoning Space Core. Triggering aerial explosion will clear all Spatial Silence stacks and deal additional number of Spatial Silence stacks x 150% ATK of Physical DMG while restoring number of Spatial Silence stacks x 5 SP. | No
**Blessing of Coleus**: Physical DMG dealt by Space Core increases by 80%. Regain 30 Herrscher Charge and gain 20% more Total DMG for 5s upon summoning Space Core. Triggering it again resets the duration. In Herrscher Form, Space Core's area of explosion is expanded and can gather surrounding enemies. | 1st
**Blessing of Annihilation**: In Herrscher Form, the 3rd SEQ of Basic ATK includes one blow of Charged ATK: Time Tremor that deals 200% ATK of Physical DMG. | Optional 2nd or 3rd
**Blessing of Virtuality**: Ultimate Evasion Skill can be triggered even without Ultimate Evasion conditions when there are no enemies along the path of Phase Shuttle. Time-slow area of effect triggered by Ultimate Evasion Skill expands and all enemies in range take 30% more Total DMG for 12s. Triggering it again resets the duration. | Optional 2nd or 3rd
**Blessing of Innateness**: Reduces CD of Ultimate Evasion Skill, weapon skill and Ultimate by 6s each when summoning Space Core. In Herrscher Form, Basic ATKs directly connect to SEQ 3 for a short duration after triggering Ultimate Evasion. | Start

!!! note
    Innateness is a must, Coleus is needed, so double Ely start is the best. Regarding Virtuality and Annihilation, if you get a 3rd Ego Door, go ahead and grab it unless you'd otherwise get an essential core. Mobius is not essential to rush and complete. There's no winner over Virtuality or Annihilation, as both are strong in their own with almost no noticeable difference whatsoever, however, if you don't like Virtuality's downsides (can make mobs have delayed spawn or lock some enemies in the air in a way that HoV can't target them and reduce her CD's with Innaneness), then Annihilation is taken.

###<p align="center">Mobius - Signet of Infinity (1st Core)</p>

!!! note
    Ideal course of build up: 2 Ego Start , 1st Core by F4, Dead [X] by F5 or F6 , Griseo by F5 or F6 , Griseo 2nd Core by F7 , 3rd and 4th Core by F11.


Signet | Priority
- | :----:
**Entwined [P]**: For every summoned entity, ELF, or Support Valkyrie present, enemies take 8% bonus Total DMG (5 stacks max). | 1st
**Rodent [V]**: For every summoned entity, ELF, or Support Valkyrie present, Valkyrie deals 10% bonus Total DMG (5 stacks max). | 2nd
**Lip Poison [E]**: Total DMG from summoned entities, ELFs, and Support Valkyries increases by 60%. | 3rd
**Lodging [C]**: ELF Ultimates and Support Valkyries' support skills have 20% reduced CD. | Optional
**Nexus Signet 1: Infinite [X]** |
**Dead [X]**: For every second in Mind Sync, Valkyrie herself, summoned entities, ELFs, and Support Valkyries deal 10% bonus Total DMG. 5 stacks max. 9 stacks max with any summoned entity present. Reset on exiting Mind Sync. | Optional

!!! note
    Lip Poison can be taken for synergy with the Ego signet, Coleus. Either that, or if you don't get Lodging in your signet choices. Dead doesn't feel as impactful this time around to get, so getting it isn't a priority.

###<p align="center">Griseo - Signet of Stars (2nd Core)</p>


Signet | Priority
- | :----:
**Red & Hot**: Using a weapon active taints enemies nearby with red paint for 8s and makes them take 25% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG (cannot stack). Triggering it again resets the duration. | 1st YES
**Black & Dark**: Every time an enemy is tainted, Valkyries deals 10% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG for 20s. 6 stacks max. | 2nd
**Blue & Cold**: Triggering an Ultimate Evasion Skill taints enemies nearby with blue paint for 8s and reduces their Total DMG and Move Speed by 30%. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 3rd
**Nexus Signet 2: Faded Stars** |
**Petals in the Wind**: When red and blue taint triggers Blending, enemies within 8m are dealt 1200%/500% ATK of Adaptive DMG; CD: 3s. Also taints yourself purple for 15s, increasing the effect of red, yellow, and blue taint by 40%. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 1st

!!! note
    Red & Hot is the absolute first priority, followed by Black & Dark. Petals in the Wind is a risky gamble to try and get. However, if you do manage to get it, the whole run will become really easy from there on. This is the main black goat of the build.

!!! danger
    From here, the order isn't that impactful. If you chose BR and don't have Virtuality, absolutely take Hua. If you don't care, pick between Sakura or Vill-V. If you chose to go with SS, you can take any of these 3.

###<p align="center">Hua - Signet of Vicissitude (3rd Core)</p>


Signet | Priority
- | :----:
**Long Trip**: Total DMG increases by 1.0% per second. 40 stacks max. Taking DMG reduces 10 stacks. | 1st
**Days Gone**: Physical DMG increases by 0.8% per second. 40 stacks max. Taking DMG reduces 10 stacks. | 2nd
**No One to Share**: Physical Breach increases by 0.6% per second. 40 stacks max. Taking DMG reduces 10 stacks. | 3rd
**Nexus Signet 2: Suffering Mass** |
**Broken Dream**: With Soldier's Remembrance stacks, the max stacks of all buffs from Normal Signets of Vicissitude increase by 20. Losing all Soldier's Remembrance stacks reduces the max stacks by 10 but restores 1 Soldier's Remembrance stack. Can only be triggered once every battle. | 1st

!!! note
    Hua is the safest way to play HoV thanks to her shield. Virtuality helps to offset this to some extent however, if you don't manage to get Hua's 2nd core in the run. The lesser but big black goat of the build.


###<p align="center">Sakura - Signet of Setsuna (4th Core)</p>


Signet | Priority
- | :----:
**Bountiful Blossom: Botan**: Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill boosts Total DMG by 40% for 8s. | 1st
**Bountiful Blossom: Koyo**: Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 30% for 8s. | 2nd
**Bountiful Blossom: Fuji**: Ultimate Evasion Skill has 1 more charge and 10% reduced CD. | 3rd
**Bountiful Blossom: Ume**: Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill boosts Attack Speed & Move Speed by 40% for 8s. | Optional
**Nexus Signet 1: Setsuna Blade: Sakura ni Maku* |

!!! note
    Fuji together with Sakura Screen are the black goats of this build. Fuji is really nasty as it intensifies the cheese even further as it allows for a constant UE spam without any 1-sec delays whatsoever due to waiting its CD. This is, however, not possible without Elysia M or SirinA M's -20% CDR on UE effects. So on these cases, Ume has the win.

###<p align="center">Vill-V - Signet of Helix (5th Core)</p>


Signet | Priority
- | :----:
**Act V: Spider Web**: Using a weapon active boosts Valkyrie ranged Total DMG by 40% for 4.5s. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 1st
**Act II: Pendulum**: Using a weapon active makes enemies take 20% bonus Total DMG for 4.5s. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 2nd
**Act IV: Spoon**: Using a weapon active boosts Physical DMG and Elemental DMG from Charge ATK and Combo ATK by 25% for 4.5s Triggering it again resets the duration. | 3rd
**Act I: Magic**: Using a weapon active boosts its Total DMG by 10%. 6 stacks max. Reset at the end of each battle. | Optional
**Act III: Conflict**: Using a weapon active boosts Valkyrie Total DMG by 20% for 4.5s Triggering it again resets the duration. | Filler
**Nexus Signet 2: Intermezzo: Holistic Helix** |
**Puppetry: Interlacing Cells**: Extends Global Time Fracture caused by Specail Weapon: No. 4's detonation by 3s. During Global Time Fracture, gain 30% Physical and Elemental Breach. | 1st
**Drama: Origin of Slumber**: During Gravitational Field, enemies take 20% more Total DMG. During Global Time Fracture caused by detonation, enemies take 30% more Total DMG in addition. | 2nd
**Saga: Overlapping Needles**: Gravitational Field affects a larger area and gain a stronger pull. DMG-dealing hits deal and extra 500% ATK of Adaptive DMG. | Filler 

!!! note
    V-V's basic signets are best taken from Felis Shop, and then proceed to get 2nd Core and get the Enhanceds at any cost IF possible. Puppetry and Drama are the mini black goats of this build.

!!! danger
    This is the strongest build in relative strength that HoV has. Ult build so far is weaker and doesn't really feel as good.

    This build is downscaleable with lower clear times and lower gear requirement. You don't necessarily have to do Finality, as such, with lower difficulties, you'll either have faster, about the same or lower clear time depending on your gear requirement.

!!! note
    Hua2 Core has been tested to be stronger and way more impactful over the 3rd Core (Aponia2). Regarding Lost and Found and Worldly Troubles, they're ONLY considered if RNG luck fucks you over like this by not giving you the signets we are looking for.

Triggering it again resets the duration. | 3rd

### 4th Core Alternatives: Kalpas and Eden

!!! note
    You pick one or the other, based on your RNG luck and whichever you have better chances of finishing their Core. Kalpas, however, is way stronger while Eden's Core can't keep uptime for the entirety of Elysia's 35s ult duration, but still works.

!!! note
    As mentioned before, for the purposes of swapping LE out in favor of other supports, you want to take Recitatif of Fine Jade. Best taken by grabbing it from Felis Shop.

###<p align="center">Griseo - Signet of Stars (Optional Signet)</p>
**Red & Hot**: Using a weapon active taints enemies nearby with red paint for 8s and makes them take 25% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG (cannot stack). Triggering it again resets the duration. | Optional YES

!!! note
    If you get blessed by Felis Shop RNG, absolutely take this. Not recommended to try and take it from door, though.

!!! danger
    This build has been done in -30% TDM reduction disadvantage weather, meaning that without the debuff this build would be way stronger and potentially reach 5m. Video of the run with additional explanation in description here: https://youtu.be/SPvdUDUO4eU

!!! note
    You don't have to worry about low health gameplay without shields. SN's repeated abuse of Ultimate Evasion and her own Ultimate will do the job of acting as I-frames. 

!!! danger
    Due to the nature of SN being, in a streak, the most unfavored valkyrie patch after patch in the rotating ER weathers, do not expect her performance and power compared to other valkyries to change. Yet, if you still want to play this valkyrie, do enjoy her. And hopefully someday Hoyoverse will consider reworking her Ego signets. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cslZh5G3YxI

#  Difference between Kalpas1 and Kalpas2: 
<p align="center">By: Butter#2252</p>

Kalpas 2 core makes you lose 5k Hp or more to give you a 40% boost from kalpas signets (increases to 8k hp lost and 80% boost from kalpas with 25% bonus hp signet). Any healing you get turns into more hp for the hp cap, meaning more hp for kalpas core two (which can further increase the 80% boost to 100% with hp% signet)

#  Difference between Su1 and Su2: 
#####<p align="center">**Su 1 vs Su 2 enhanced only**</p>
<p align="center">By: Butter#2252</p>

**Su 1 enhanced signets:**
Maxim of Anitya: enemies hit by karma wheels can not regenerate sheilds for 3 seconds.

Maxim of Anatman: the next attack with in 8 seconds by an enemy hit by karma wheel has that attack lose 50% total damage. 

Maxim of Santam: karma wheels deal 100% bonus damage to  shielded and  500% additional adaptive damage to unshielded enemies.

Maxim of Anitya does not remove shields it just makes the enemy not able to recover them which is only useful against heimdel and that it.  Maxim of Anatman looks good but then you remember that it only affects ONE attack and since most enemies have multi hit moves you are still going to take the full damage of the other oh and this doesn’t work with fu hua core 2 enhanced signet worldly troubles. Maxim of Santam is the only good one as it’s more damage but that’s it.

——————————

**Su 2 enhanced signets:**

Dictum of Anitya: for every debuff in the enemy Bodhi open eye will deal 150% more damage

Dictum of Anatman: Bodhi open eye debuffs last 3 seconds longer and for every debuff on the enemy, they receive 5% more total damage taken from the enemy

Dictum of Santam: Bodhi open eye will apply 3 random debuffs for 3 seconds

Dictum is the king of enemy total damage taken as the trance debuff which is part of the core is a debuff it already means anatman makes them have 5% more. Then santam applies 3 random of the following debuffs (stun, paralyze, Ignite, freeze, impair, weaken, attack slow and move slow) that’s 7 more debuffs! Now anatman and anitya also counts anything that is labeled as a debuff so this includes: Trance, Intoxication (eden 1), weapon skill debuffs, shield shattered (Carole), HoT mark, Analyzed (HoR), Coma (HoS), Immobilized (jailer, AE ult), etc. with all of that said you can see how good Su 2 is with its enhanced than Su 1. Also with all 8 debuffs the enemy has gained 40% more total damage taken. And that’s level 1. At level 3 that’s 64% damage taken.
