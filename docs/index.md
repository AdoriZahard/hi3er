<p align="center">**Note: The number behind the Signet Name represents the core**</p>
<p align="center">**Eg: Su2 = Su - Signet of Bodhi Core 2 (Dictum of Bodhi)**</p>

<p align="center">The signets are arranged in order of priority</p>

Difficulties have changed and here are their values:

- 1D Void = 90D
- 2D Shroud = 100D
- 3D Inferno = 110D
- 4D Submergence = 120D
- 5D Abstinence = 130D
- 6D Corruption = 140D
- 7D Finality = 150D

Please note that this is only true for there reward scores, and not the actual previous difficulties pre v5.6

**What do these mean?**

- Yes = At some point get this signet. It doesn't matter when, just that you obtain it, as its a signet needed to make the build work.
- 1st/2nd/etc = Get this 1st/2nd/etc
- Start = Start with this signet
- Optional = You can take it, but not necessary (mostly if your stigmatas' are bad)
- Filler = Only consider going for this if the other portals suck.
- No = Don't get this.

### <p align="center">-- FT General Build 7D</p>

!!! note 
    Updated 6.0. In terms of downscalability, this build sucks for that. It's linked to the valk herself. What does this mean? Basically, you'd rather be using another valk instead of FT if your FT is a bit too downscaled. Needs Sleeper's Dream as minimum, otherwise her ER gameplay is really painful.

> Boss to be Chosen: Husk, then Vill-V

!!! note
    Why not Hephaestus? Because, despite FT type-countering Heph and even with Griseo2, she's actually awfully horrible against Heph. It also doesn't help that her personal single damage against Bosses is dogshit despite everything. Husk is way easier. Also simpler to parry his attacks.

    Sleeper's Dream is the minimum requirement, otherwise FT is really painful to play. In stigmatas, she's kinda flexible being able to use 3-set BiankaT, Ely TB, Polo TM Attila B. However the performance of these stigmatas are expected to be really varied. Don't expect impressive results from them.

!!! note
    This build works with 2 Ego signets mainly: Silence + Mixing. Those 2 are essential. FT without gather is absolutely horrible. No Mixing means FT is unplayable. Regarding other Ego signets, she really loves the opportunity to take a 3rd and 4th; Thorns and Solitude are your best choices respectively.

!!! note
    Note: White is essential due to FT's severe lack of SP regen without Thorns and particularly during Fervent Mode (which incentivizes you to just let Fervent Mode end so you can regen SP again), so if you get Thorns beforehand, you basically ignore White. Also, due to no on-demand UE, you'll want to intentionally let enemies attack you and evade so you can proc Blue paint, and along with it, Fallen Leaves and Petals in the Wind. Especially Fallen Leaves as it gives a really noticeable shitload of dmg buff to FT.

    The minimum requirement of Tuna is to have Heatflow and Reburn as her starting signets. Without Reburn, she feels awful to play. Without Heatflow, she doesn't feel like she has much damage. So, a double Ego start is essential for Tuna. Afterwards, getting a 3rd Ego door is very good, taking Tempered Warrior to make the entire run easier and feel better. 4th is also taken for Starfire, adding even more damage but it's not really necessary.

!!! danger
    You leave Kalpas enhanceds for later on. 2 reasons. Getting a Sakura signet or being able to finish Hua 2nd Core by F7 double or even getting Tempered Warrior is higher value. And trying to get one after finishing his 2nd core is a massive slowdown on the pace, as it feels like it's not really doing anything to help u. This is the reason getting other signets instead is better. So, leave this for after you get 2nd core.

!!! note
    I also strongly recommend upgrading Kalpas' Max HP after both of his DMG boosts if you're using Himeko. Himeko M giving 25% max HP paired with Kalpas 40% Max HP from +3 and Pardofelis Max HP signet makes it possible to reach up to 16k or 17k HP which gives Kalpas an absolutely massive scaling on his +3 DMG Boosts. When using Shelley T Himeko M Scott B variation, it's even more of a priority as it reaches up to 22.5k HP.

    Sakura's Core is not necessary to complete. After getting Fuji, you can proceed to focus on getting Griseo and finishing Sakura 1st core on later floors, particularly after Mech Land. Also, Ayame is good to consider taking for the purposes of getting Yellow applied through early Ultimate so you can get your maximum damage output as soon as possible, however you can also instead pick Eden's Initial/Max SP for this.

!!! note
    Due to HoFS' problem of using Ult right away to apply Yellow, you'll usually want to leave at least one charge of UE for the purposes of being able to reset Overheat meter right after using Ultimate. Also one important thing to note here: You'll want to make sure to get Yellow next if you happen to get Fallen Leaves from a Griseo door. Or in the case you get A Flame Extinguished, then pick Yellow over it.

    You want to save BR specifically for after entering Herrscher Mode on the first snap. Basically, when you're about to use your first Blackhole in Herrscher Form for the maximum output of damage possible.

####<p align="center">Elysia - Signet of ■■</p>

Signet | Priority
------|:----:
**Blessing of Heatflow**: Black holes generated by the Herrscher of Flamescion deal 75% bonus Fire DMG. Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill creates an additional black hole | **Start**
**Blessing of Reburn** Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill removes Overheat and clears Heat | 1st
**Blessing of Tempered Warrior** Aerial Combo ATKs reduce Ultimate Evasion Skill CD by 9s | 2nd
**Blessing of Starfire** When a black hole created by the Herrscher of Flamescion ends, a smaller black hole lasting 5s is generated to deal 300% ATK of Fire DMG per second. CD: 3s | Optional
**Blessing of Flamescion** For every black hole created by the Herrscher of Flamescion, Valkyrie restores 25 HP per second and deals 30% bonus Total DMG | No

!!! note
    The minimum requirement of Tuna is to have Heatflow and Reburn as her starting signets. Without Reburn, she feels awful to play. Without Heatflow, she doesn't feel like she has much damage. So, a double Ego start is essential for Tuna. Afterwards, getting a 3rd Ego door is very good, taking Tempered Warrior to make the entire run easier and feel better. 4th is also taken for Starfire, adding even more damage but it's not really necessary.

!!! danger
    If using Leuween TB Thales M, Tempered Warrior becomes an absolute must. Either you get it early, or you hope to get it later; if you don't get it early, Setsuna's Fuji will become a priority to get as soon as possible, preferentially in F5 or F6 shop.

####<p align="center">Kalpas - Signet of Decimation (1st Core)</p>

Signet | Priority
- | :----:
**Blade, Grave and Scar**: Every 100 HP loss boosts Total DMG by 1.0%. | 1st
**Bone, Blood and Ribbon**: Every 100 HP loss boosts Physical & Elemental DMG by 0.8%. | 2nd
**Path, Misfortune and Written Fate**: Max HP increases by 25%. | 3rd
**Desireless, Mindless and Homeless**: Losing HP boosts Total DMG taken by all enemies by 25% for 8s. | 4th
**Nexus Signet 2: Soldiers, Scissors, Spoils, and Slaughter** |
**Hometown, Homeland, Friends, and Acquaintances**: The cap of Bloodboil Armor charges increases by 500. At over 1500 charges, Bloodboil Armor grants 25% Physical and Elemental Breach. | Optional (Priority only by F9 afterwards)
**Body, Bones, Heart, and Soul**: The Bloodboil Armor charges cap increases by 500. When its charges exceed 1500, if it gains HP recovery, when it next deals DMG to enemies, it will have a bonus 800% ATK of adaptive DMG. CD: 5s. | Optional (Not necessary)

!!! danger
    Kalpas Enhanceds, no matter if you're running Himeko or Leuween Thales, are never good to take right after completing his core. Instead of wasting one door for F5 or F6 with Kalpas, use it for either Sakura or Griseo, or go shop and get Fuji, then proceed with Griseo signets.

!!! note
    I also strongly recommend upgrading Kalpas' Max HP after both of his DMG boosts if you're using Himeko. Himeko M giving 25% max HP paired with Kalpas 40% Max HP from +3 and Pardofelis Max HP signet makes it possible to reach up to 16k or 17k HP which gives Kalpas an absolutely massive scaling on his +3 DMG Boosts.

####<p align="center">Sakura - Signet of Setsuna (2nd Core)</p>

**Bountiful Blossom: Botan**: Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill boosts Total DMG by 40% for 8s. | 3rd
**Bountiful Blossom: Ayame**: Triggering Ultimate Evasion Skill restores 12.0 bonus SP | Optional
**Nexus Signet 1: Setsuna Blade: Sakura-ni-Maku** | 

!!! danger
    Fuji is a first priority if the next 2 conditions are met: Using Leuween TB Thales M and no Tempered Warrior before F7. In Himeko's case, it won't matter if you get it without Tempered Warrior, but will do a big favor for you, so it's still good to take. 

!!! note
    After getting Fuji, you can then proceed to leave completing Sakura by F11 onwards, with Griseo taking the priority. Also, Ayame is good to consider taking for the purposes of getting Yellow applied through early Ultimate so you can get your maximum damage output as soon as possible.

!!! note
    Due to HoFS' problem of using Ult right away to apply Yellow, you'll usually want to leave at least one charge of UE for the purposes of being able to reset Overheat meter right after using Ultimate.

    This build is downscaleable with lower clear time based on stats/gears/rank and lower difficulties. Double Clear is not necessary but is nice, you can perfectly clear with this build, especially in 6.0 weather. The one important thing to note from this build is that, especially if you're downscaling in gears but not on difficulty, you want to learn to time The Lonely Moon perfectly into clearing a new wave of mobs right away. Even 1 or 2 seconds later is still fine. Griseo's skill is monstruously op when used this way, due to how easily it can delete waves instantly and apply all your unlocked paints if they're somehow alive still.

Signet | Priority
------|:----:
**Blessing of Victory**: In Herrscher Form, Combo ATK: Slashes can have up to 18 slashes. After reaching 7 slashes, every slash deals 600% ATK of Physical DMG. | Start
**Blessing of Ego**: Casting Combo ATK summons an illusion (summoned entity) to replicate the attack. In Herrscher Form, the illusion only replicates the slashes each dealing 105% ATK of Physical DMG. The illusion has 400% of the Valkyrie's ATK. | 1st
**Blessing of Dark Plumes**: Combo ATK restores 1 SP on hit and unleashes a plume attack on hit that deals 150% ATK of Physical DMG. CD: 0.5s | Optional
**Blessing of Supremacy**: Shield: I'm Untouchable absorbs 100% of DMG taken and deals 5000% ATK of Physical DMG to enemies within 8 metres when it ends or resets. | Filler
**Blessing of Legion**: Sword, spear and chain combo attacks restore 300 sword, spear and chain energy respectively and boost Total DMG by 60% for 8s. | No

!!! note
    This build only requires 2, Victory and Ego. Double start is strictly necessary as Ego and Mobius are the main core of this build. You can also take Dark Plumes as 3rd but no more, which will massively help with the SP regen and make the build smoother, especially before F7 as it will be lacking.

####<p align="center">Mobius - Signet of Infinity (1st Core)</p>

!!! note
    Ideal Order from F1-F7: Double Reroll into 5 max Mobius signets, then 1 Aponia door before F7, then finish Aponia for F7 double.

**Newborn [X]**: Triggering Mind Sync again during Mind Sync no longer resets the duration but extends the duration by 4.0s instead. With any summoned entity present, the duration is extended by 5s additionally. | Optional 

!!! note
    Lip Poison start is the most meaningful, as it has more noticeable damage increase. Also, Lodging is far more valuable than Rodent for finishing 1st core, allowing you to use SN for F7 on Smelter Zombie making it easier to get the double on time. Regarding Newborn, it's only considered if you want to upgrade Dead [X].

!!! note
    The moment you get any of the basic paints of Griseo, the gameplay changes. It's essential to save the weapon active and UE skill to time them together with her Ultimate, having all 3 paints. Taint Extension is also very crucial for this, as the +0 alone will increase the duration from 8s to 13s, making up for an entire ult duration of 2 complete series of Victory Slashes.

    Ensuing Regret takes priority only and only if you get Kalpas2 and you're going to get his Enhanceds, mainly his breach or the adaptive dmg. Otherwise Perpetual Wait is always the choice over this as it'll be more consistent and Kalpas2 is usually left for later floors. Be advised though, that these are not recommended to look after unless you have no choice due to RNG.

    This build's downscalability in terms of weapon and stigmatas has yet to be tested.

    Taint Extension is a must to grab in-between getting the 2 Enhanceds, all 3 basic paints and Black & Dark.

    These above are listed based on their potential strength. First listed is the strongest. Also, watch out for builds without SirinA M or Elysia M, as the playstyle changes a bit.

!!! note
    This build is downscaleable with lower clear times and lower gear requirement. You don't necessarily have to do Finality, as such, with lower difficulties, you'll either have faster, about the same or lower clear time depending on your gear requirement. However, do note that this valkyrie requires at least Keys of Void to be played in ER. Without her signature weapon, she can't stay in permanent Herrscher Mode.

    Innateness is a must, Coleus is needed, so double Ely start is the best. Regarding Virtuality and Annihilation, if you get a 3rd Ego Door, go ahead and grab it unless you'd otherwise get an essential core. Griseo and Vill-V are essential cores. There's no winner over Virtuality or Annihilation, as both are strong in their own with almost no noticeable difference whatsoever, however, if you don't like Virtuality's downsides (can make mobs have delayed spawn or lock some enemies in the air in a way that HoV can't target them and reduce her CD's with Innaneness), then Annihilation is taken. However, in the case you don't get Hua2 or aren't planning to get her, take Virtuality 100%.

!!! note
    Hua is the safest way to play HoV thanks to her shield, and especially as Kalpas2 + BR is used for this. Virtuality helps to offset this to some extent however, if you don't manage to get Hua's 2nd core in the run, and makes Hua lower priority.

### <p align="center">-- Gate of Babylon Build 7D</p>

!!! note
    Updated for 6.0. Slower clear build, but in terms of strength, it's vastly superior.

> Boss to be Chosen: Husk or *Hephaestus, then Elysia, Aponia or Vill-V

!!! note
    Hephaestus is only ever taken if you want the fastest clear time for F17. If you aren't looking for that, then by any means, just stick with Husk instead, as it's the safer and more comfortable option.

####<p align="center">Setup</p>

!!! note
    This build is downscaleable with lower clear times and lower gear requirement. You don't necessarily have to do Finality, as such, with lower difficulties, you'll either have faster, about the same or lower clear time depending on your gear requirement. However, do note that this valkyrie requires at least Keys of Void to be played in ER. Without her signature weapon, she can't stay in permanent Herrscher Mode.

Signet | Priority
------|:----:
**Blessing of Law**: Aerial explosion triggered after Ultimate ends deal 2000% ATK of Physical DMG. Gain Spatial Silence stacks after summoning Space Core. Triggering aerial explosion will clear all Spatial Silence stacks and deal additional number of Spatial Silence stacks x 150% ATK of Physical DMG while restoring number of Spatial Silence stacks x 5 SP. | 1st
**Blessing of Coleus**: Physical DMG dealt by Space Core increases by 80%. Regain 30 Herrscher Charge and gain 20% more Total DMG for 5s upon summoning Space Core. Triggering it again resets the duration. In Herrscher Form, Space Core's area of explosion is expanded and can gather surrounding enemies. | Optional 2nd
**Blessing of Annihilation**: In Herrscher Form, the 3rd SEQ of Basic ATK includes one blow of Charged ATK: Time Tremor that deals 200% ATK of Physical DMG. | No
**Blessing of Virtuality**: Ultimate Evasion Skill can be triggered even without Ultimate Evasion conditions when there are no enemies along the path of Phase Shuttle. Time-slow area of effect triggered by Ultimate Evasion Skill expands and all enemies in range take 30% more Total DMG for 12s. Triggering it again resets the duration. | Optional 3rd
**Blessing of Innateness**: Reduces CD of Ultimate Evasion Skill, weapon skill and Ultimate by 6s each when summoning Space Core. In Herrscher Form, Basic ATKs directly connect to SEQ 3 for a short duration after triggering Ultimate Evasion. | **Start**

!!! note
    Innateness is a must, Law is the core of this build. You can also take 3rd and 4th Ego doors, which would respectively be Coleus and Virtuality. They aren't needed, however they are nice to have, especially Coleus for the gather. Virtuality on the other hand lets you play safely.

####<p align="center">Mobius - Signet of Infinity (1st Core)</p>

**Unknown [X]**: Triggering Mind Sync again during Mind Sync reduces the CD of ELF Ultimates and Support Valkyries' support skills by 2s. With any summoned entity present, the CDs are reduced by 2s additionally. This effect can only be triggered once per 4s. | Optional

!!! note
    Dead [X] is an absolute must especially with downscaled gears as it makes up for a really significant buff to damage for the remainder of the run once you get it. Lodging and Unknown can be taken when downscaling or when no better options.

**Yellow & Warm**: Using an Ultimate taints enemies nearby with yellow paint for 8s and makes them take 30% bonus Total DMG. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 2nd
**Black & Dark**: Every time an enemy is tainted, Valkyries deals 10% bonus Physical and Elemental DMG for 20s. 6 stacks max. | 3rd
**Blue & Cold**: Triggering an Ultimate Evasion Skill taints enemies nearby with blue paint for 8s and reduces their Total DMG and Move Speed by 30%. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 4th

**A Flame Extinguished**: When red and yellow taint triggers Blending you become tainted orange for 15s, triggering Time Fracture for 2.5s and reducing enemy Physical Defense 40% and Elemental Resist 15% for 10s; CD: 7s. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 1st
**Fallen Leaves**: When yellow and blue taint triggers Blending along with an AoE ATK dealing 800% ATK of Adaptive DMG; CD: 3s. Also taints yourself green for 15s, increasing Total DMG 20% for each taint in Faded Stars. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 2nd
**Petals in the Wind**: When red and blue taint triggers Blending, enemies within 8m are dealt 1200%/500% ATK of Adaptive DMG; CD: 3s. Also taints yourself purple for 15s, increasing the effect of red, yellow, and blue taint by 40%. Triggering it again resets the duration. | 3rd

!!! note
    Red & Hot is the absolute first priority, followed by Yellow & Warm and Black & Dark. A Flame Extinguished is ideal 1st in this build due to ease of proc for finishing with Ultimate and because of the 40% Phys Def reduction, however if you end up missing one of the 3 paints, take one of the other 3 enhanceds according to which ones you have.

!!! note
    Hua here is mainly for the unconditional Breach which you'll want to prioritize to upgrade. It is also the safest way to play HoV thanks to her shield, and especially as Kalpas2 + BR is used for this. Virtuality helps to offset this to some extent however, if you don't manage to get Hua's 2nd core in the run.

!!! note
    You can abuse the trick at Shop for switching one support to BR, use it, switch BR out and put her again, rinse and repeat to bring your HP down to 100 to use Kalpas buffs to the fullest even if you don't get Kalpas 2nd Core.

!!! note
    Dark Assault + Ill Fortune is all Mobius needs to clear. However, if you want to be extra safe, you can do double Ego start to pick Ascension up. Ravenousness is also a very good choice to consider taking if you get a 4th Ego door.

####<p align="center">Mobius - Signet of Infinity (1st Core)</p>

    Ideal Order from F1-F7: If not doing Double Ego start: Hua Elem Breach by F2, grab Infinity by F3, complete Mobius 1st Core by F4, take either Dead [X] or Unknown [X] by F5, then go shop, grab Griseo's Red and Yellow or Black paints, complete Hua by 7F, proceed to finish Griseo afterwards

!!! note
    From my experience, Dead [X] doesn't change things much. I've even found far better result with Unknown thanks to its usefulness of reducing AE and LE's CD to have them available for use earlier. As such, Dead [X] is perfectly fine to be taken at a later floor in case you don't get it and instead get Unknown.

    Hua is the best 2nd Core to get from testing results. The reason is due to Mobius lacking breach, which becomes even more evident if you leave it for in exchange to getting Griseo done.

    In terms of downscaling, LK probably doesn't have much options honestly.

###<p align="center">-- Miss Elysia Build 7D*</p>

!!! note
    Updated for 6.0 2nd Half. This time around, MPE is Herrscher-level strength in terms of clear speed, however in downscaling there might be a very noticeable difference as her Rank-ups are really good for her DPS.

> Boss to be Chosen: Hephaestus, then Mobius or Vill-V

    This build is downscaleable with lower clear times and lower gear requirement, however the ceiling for downscaling is pretty tight as MPE's strength evidently goes down a bit too much without her weapon or even without her Elysia set.

**Blessing of Zenith**: While Ultimate is active, each ricochet deals 15% ATK of bonus Physical DMG on hit. Every wave of ricochet reduces weapon active's CD by 0.6s. | **Start**

!!! note
    This build requires only 2, Zenith and Purity. Beauty is not necessary, however it's free 35% TDM Taken to take, which is really strong for early and for the rest of the run, so it is strongly advised that you do F2 Ego start. Otherwise, prefer to go for a Griseo F2 start for taking her Red paint.

####<p align="center">Vill-V - Signet of Helix (1st Core)</p>

**Blessing of Exodus**: Last hit of Equinox Severance consumes Knight Guardian and impairs enemies | **Start**

!!! note
    Exodus and Abyssal Chant are vital so double start is essential. Exodus is the start, and Abyssal Chant is the 2nd Ego signet to take. The importance of it lies in that due to it recharging the UE charges instantly, PE really needs it to keep spamming Equinox Severance which will also give you a constant cycle of enough SP regen to keep using Ult anytime you need it and it comes back off CD. Commitment in the other hand increases PE's damage by a lot as it makes her Gunlance damage actually matter and be part of her big numbers. Additionally, Equinox Severance provides a small gather that might not be noticeable but it's actually very consistent and good. The radius of effect however isn't that big, so take note of that.

    An very important thing to note here, if you don't have Purana, you shouldn't be taking Cat's Eyes at all. Purana is essential in that just by having it, you can then ignore Tailpiece. However, if you don't have it, as you'll be missing the 30% CD reduction on ultimate, you need Tailpiece because otherwise your ult will be on CD and Runaway state will run out. Tailpiece helps negate this.

    This build is downscaleable with lower clear time based on stats/gears/rank and lower difficulties. However, I can't say how she will work without Cezanne as most of Griseo's damage in ER comes from her bleed damage. A bit weird to work around. But there's probably a way to work around it, which I will look into later.

!!! note
    You don't have to worry about low health gameplay without shields. SN's repeated abuse of Ultimate Evasion and her own Ultimate will do the job of acting as I-frames.

    Due to the nature of SN being, in a streak, the most unfavored valkyrie patch after patch in the rotating ER weathers, do not expect her performance and power compared to other valkyries to change. Yet, if you still want to play this valkyrie, do enjoy her. And hopefully someday Hoyoverse will consider reworking her Ego signets.

##  Difference between Kalpas1 and Kalpas2: 
<p align="center">By: Butter#2252</p>

Kalpas 2 core makes you lose 5k Hp or more to give you a 40% boost from kalpas signets (increases to 8k hp lost and 80% boost from kalpas with 25% bonus hp signet). Any healing you get turns into more hp for the hp cap, meaning more hp for kalpas core two (which can further increase the 80% boost to 100% with hp% signet)

##  Difference between Su1 and Su2: 
######<p align="center">**Su 1 vs Su 2 enhanced only**</p>
<p align="center">By: Butter#2252</p>

**Su 1 enhanced signets:**
Maxim of Anitya: enemies hit by karma wheels can not regenerate sheilds for 3 seconds.

Maxim of Anatman: the next attack with in 8 seconds by an enemy hit by karma wheel has that attack lose 50% total damage. 

Maxim of Santam: karma wheels deal 100% bonus damage to  shielded and  500% additional adaptive damage to unshielded enemies.

Maxim of Anitya does not remove shields it just makes the enemy not able to recover them which is only useful against heimdel and that it.  Maxim of Anatman looks good but then you remember that it only affects ONE attack and since most enemies have multi hit moves you are still going to take the full damage of the other oh and this doesn’t work with fu hua core 2 enhanced signet worldly troubles. Maxim of Santam is the only good one as it’s more damage but that’s it.

——————————

**Su 2 enhanced signets:**

Dictum of Anitya: for every debuff in the enemy Bodhi open eye will deal 150% more damage

Dictum of Anatman: Bodhi open eye debuffs last 3 seconds longer and for every debuff on the enemy, they receive 5% more total damage taken from the enemy

Dictum of Santam: Bodhi open eye will apply 3 random debuffs for 3 seconds

Dictum is the king of enemy total damage taken as the trance debuff which is part of the core is a debuff it already means anatman makes them have 5% more. Then santam applies 3 random of the following debuffs (stun, paralyze, Ignite, freeze, impair, weaken, attack slow and move slow) that’s 7 more debuffs! Now anatman and anitya also counts anything that is labeled as a debuff so this includes: Trance, Intoxication (eden 1), weapon skill debuffs, shield shattered (Carole), HoT mark, Analyzed (HoR), Coma (HoS), Immobilized (jailer, AE ult), etc. with all of that said you can see how good Su 2 is with its enhanced than Su 1. Also with all 8 debuffs the enemy has gained 40% more total damage taken. And that’s level 1. At level 3 that’s 64% damage taken.
